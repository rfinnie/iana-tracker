ADLER32,"The ADLER32 algorithm is a checksum specified in RFC1950 ""ZLIB
      Compressed Data Format"". The 32-bit output is encoded in hexadecimal
      (using between 1 and 8 ASCII characters from 0-9, A-F, and a-f;
      leading 0's are allowed). For example, ADLER32=03da0195 and ADLER32=3DA0195
      are both valid checksums for the 4-byte message ""Wiki"".",[RFC1950][RFC3309][Paul_Millar]
CRC32c,"The CRC32c algorithm is a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check. It achieves a better hamming distance (for better error-detection performance) than many other 32-bit CRC functions. Other places it is used include iSCSI and SCTP. The 32-bit output is encoded in hexadecimal (using between 1 and 8 ASCII characters from 0-9, A-F, and a-f; leading 0's are allowed). For example, CRC32c=0a72a4df and crc32c=A72A4DF are both valid checksums for the 3-byte message ""dog"".","[RFC9260, Appendix A]"
