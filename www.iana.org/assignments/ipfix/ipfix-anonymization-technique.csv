0,Undefined,"The Exporting Process makes no representation as to whether the defined field is anonymized or not. While the Collecting Process MAY assume that
        the field is not anonymized, it is not guaranteed not to be. This is the default anonymization technique.",all,all,[RFC6235]
1,None,The values exported are real.,all,all,[RFC6235]
2,Precision Degradation/Truncation,"The values exported are anonymized using simple precision degradation or truncation.  The new precision or number of truncated bits is implicit in the exported data, and can be deduced by the Collecting Process.",all,all,[RFC6235]
3,Binning,The values exported are anonymized into bins.,all,all,[RFC6235]
4,Enumeration,The values exported are anonymized by enumeration.,all,timestamps,[RFC6235]
5,Permutation,The values exported are anonymized by permutation.,all,identifiers,[RFC6235]
6,Structured Permutation,"The values exported are anonymized by permutation, preserving bit-level structure as appropriate; this represents prefix-preserving IP address anonymization or structured MAC address anonymization.",all,,[RFC6235]
