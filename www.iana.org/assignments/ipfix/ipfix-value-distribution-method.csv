0,Unspecified,"The counters for an Original Flow are explicitly not distributed according to any other method
        defined for this Information Element; use for arbitrary
        distribution, or distribution algorithms not described by
        any other codepoint.",[RFC7015]
1,Start Interval,The counters for an Original Flow are added to the counters of the appropriate Aggregated Flow containing the start time of the Original Flow. This should be assumed the default if value distribution information is not available at a Collecting Process for an Aggregated Flow.,[RFC7015]
2,End Interval,The counters for an Original Flow are added to the counters of the appropriate Aggregated Flow containing the end time of the Original Flow.,[RFC7015]
3,Mid Interval,The counters for an Original Flow are added to the counters of a single appropriate Aggregated Flow containing some timestamp between start and end time of the Original Flow.,[RFC7015]
4,Simple Uniform Distribution,"Each counter for an Original
        Flow is divided by the number of time intervals the Original Flow covers (i.e., of appropriate Aggregated Flows sharing the same Flow Key), and this number is added to each corresponding counter in each Aggregated Flow.",[RFC7015]
5,Proportional Uniform Distribution,"Each counter for an Original Flow is divided by the number of time units the Original Flow covers, to derive a mean count rate.  This mean count rate is then multiplied by the number of time units in the intersection of the duration of the Original Flow and the time interval of each Aggregated Flow.  This is like simple uniform distribution, but accounts for the fractional portions of a time interval covered by an Original Flow in the first and last time interval.",[RFC7015]
6,Simulated Process,"Each counter of the Original Flow is distributed among the intervals of the Aggregated Flows according to some function the Intermediate Aggregation Process uses based upon properties of Flows presumed to be like the Original Flow.  This is essentially an assertion that the Intermediate Aggregation Process has no direct packet timing information but is nevertheless not using one of the other simpler distribution methods.
        The Intermediate Aggregation Process specifically makes no assertion as to the correctness of the simulation.",[RFC7015]
7,Direct,"The Intermediate Aggregation Process has access
        to the original packet timings from the packets making up
        the Original Flow, and uses these to distribute or
        recalculate the counters.",[RFC7015]
