MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: vnd.afpc.foca-codedfont

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary (framed transport)

Being an object inside of the AFP MO:DCA specification, a coded font 
   carries binary data. The recommended content-transfer-encoding is 
   "base64".

Security considerations: Coded Fonts are part of MO:DCA, which is an 
   architected specification of final-form presentation data. It is 
   not a programming language, does not contain any file operators, 
   and therefore cannot corrupt a receiver's file system or 
   programming environment. It does not allow executable content or 
   calls to external applications.

   The format does not provide integrity or privacy protection in 
   itself. Integrity on file level could be ensured by means external
   to the specification.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: As part of "FOCA Reference (Font Object 
   Content Architecture Reference)", AFP Consortium publication 
   AFPC-0007-06.

Application usage: A coded font is a MO:DCA resource object that 
   associates character set objects with code page objects. A coded 
   font resource does not contain either the font character set 
   object or the code page object, but only references those objects 
   by name.

   Used in Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) generators and 
   consumers. A wide variety of applications are created by members 
   of the AFP Consortium and other parties.

Fragment Identifier Considerations: N/A

Restrictions in Usage: This format is mostly used in applications 
   around high speed transactional printing.
