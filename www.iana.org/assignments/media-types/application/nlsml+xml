(RFC 6787 published November 2012, subtype last updated November 2012)

MIME media type name:  application

MIME subtype name:  nlsml+xml

Required parameters:  none

Optional parameters:

   charset:  All of the considerations described in RFC 3023
      [RFC3023] also apply to the application/nlsml+xml media type.

Encoding considerations:  All of the considerations described in RFC
   3023 also apply to the 'application/nlsml+xml' media type.

Security considerations:  As with HTML, NLSML documents contain links
   to other data stores (grammars, verifier resources, etc.).  Unlike
   HTML, however, the data stores are not treated as media to be
   rendered.  Nevertheless, linked files may themselves have security
   considerations, which would be those of the individual registered
   types.  Additionally, this media type has all of the security
   considerations described in RFC 3023.

Interoperability considerations:  Although an NLSML document is
   itself a complete XML document, for a fuller interpretation of the
   content a receiver of an NLSML document may wish to access
   resources linked to by the document.  The inability of an NLSML
   processor to access or process such linked resources could result
   in different behavior by the ultimate consumer of the data.

Published specification:  RFC 6787

Applications that use this media type:  MRCPv2 clients and servers

Additional information:  none

Magic number(s):  There is no single initial octet sequence that is
