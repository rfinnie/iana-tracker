MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: dns

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters: None.

Encoding considerations: The data format is binary, and data must be
transfered unmodified. Using encodings intended for textual parts is
not recommended.

Security considerations: This media type identifies content as being
detached DNS information, as documented in RFC 2540 [4]. This data
may be security relevant as per RFC 2538 [7] or may be secured
information as per RFC 2535 [6]. Securing the content further may be
done with standard techniques, such as OpenPGP [5] or CMS [9], but
this is outside of the scope here. Further security assessments are
not available at this point.

Interoperability considerations: The encoding of detached DNS
information is, unlike textual master files, well defined. No
further interoperability considerations are known.

Published specification: The format of data that could be tagged with
this media type is documented in RFC 2540 [4].

Applications that use this media type: DNS-related software,
including software storing and using certificates stored in DNS.
