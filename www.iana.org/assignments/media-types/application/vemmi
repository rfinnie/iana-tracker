(RFC 2122 published March 1997, subtype last updated March 1997)

MIME media type name: "application"

MIME subtype name: "vemmi"

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:
- version:
  an optional version number may be specified, in the format:

    version=<integer>

  The version number is a numeric integer whose is encoded as the
  <version> parameter defined in ETS 300 709 (e.g. version=100), and
  whose the first digit represents the major VEMMI version number.
  It must be pointed out that the VEMMI objects includes the VEMMI
  version and a timestamp.

ENCODING CONSIDERATIONS:

   The "base64" mechanism is preferred because VEMMI use a native 8-bit
   binary file format. However, as VEMMI includes its own 7-bits
   encoding mechanisms, VEMMI data could also be transmitted in 7-bit
   mode.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

   Refer to paragraph 8.

INTEROPERABILITY CONSIDERATIONS:

   VEMMI is designed to be fully platform independent, and the VEMMI
   objects and contents could interoperate between any platform. The
   only exception are the VEMMI operative objects that could be binary
   programs specific to a given hardware platform and operating system.
