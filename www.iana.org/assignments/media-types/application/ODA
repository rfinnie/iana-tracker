(RFC 1494 published August 1993, subtype last updated August 1993)

The Application/ODA content-type

The "ODA" subtype of application is used to indicate that a body
contains information encoded according to the Office Document
Architecture [4] standards, using the ODIF representation format.
For application/oda, the Content- Type line should also specify an
attribute/value pair that indicates the document application profile
(DAP), using the key word "profile", and the document class, using
the keyword "class".

For the keyword "class", the values "formatted", "processable" and
"formatted-processable" are legal values.

Thus an appropriate header field  might look like this:

    Content-Type:  application/oda; profile=Q112;
    class=formatted

Consult the ODA standard [4] for further information.

The Base64 content-transfer-encoding is appropriate for carrying ODA.
