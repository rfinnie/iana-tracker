   See Section 3 of RFC7303.

Encoding considerations:  Depending on the character encoding used,
   XML MIME entities can consist of 7bit, 8bit or binary data
   [RFC6838].  For 7-bit transports, 7bit data, for example US-ASCII-
   encoded data, does not require content-transfer-encoding, but 8bit
   or binary data, for example UTF-8 or UTF-16 data, MUST be content-
   transfer-encoded in quoted-printable or base64.  For 8-bit clean
   transport (e.g. 8BITMIME ESMTP [RFC6152] or NNTP [RFC3977]), 7bit
   or 8bit data, for example US-ASCII or UTF-8 data, does not require
   content-transfer-encoding, but binary data, for example data with
   a UTF-16 encoding, MUST be content-transfer-encoded in base64.

   For binary clean transports (e.g.  BINARY ESMTP [RFC3030] or HTTP
   [HTTPbis]), no content-transfer-encoding is necessary (or even
   possible, in the case of HTTP) for 7bit, 8bit or binary data.

Security considerations:  See Section 10 of RFC7303.

Interoperability considerations:  XML has proven to be interoperable
   across both generic and task-specific applications and for import
   and export from multiple XML authoring and editing tools.
   Validating processors provide maximum interoperability, because
   they have to handle all aspects of XML.  Although a non-validating
   processor may be more efficient, it might not handle all aspects.
   For further information, see sub-section 2.9 "Standalone Document
   Declaration" and section 5 "Conformance" of [XML] .

   In practice, character set issues have proved to be the biggest
   source of interoperability problems.  The use of UTF-8, and
   careful attention to the guidelines set out in Section 3, are the
   best ways to avoid such problems.

Published specification:  Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth
   Edition) [XML] or subsequent editions or versions thereof.

Applications that use this media type:  XML is device-, platform-,
   and vendor-neutral and is supported by generic and task-specific
   applications and a wide range of generic XML tools (editors,
   parsers, Web agents, ...).

Additional information:

   Magic number(s):  None.

      Although no byte sequences can be counted on to always be
      present, XML MIME entities in ASCII-compatible character sets
      (including UTF-8) often begin with hexadecimal 3C 3F 78 6D 6C
      ("<?xml"), and those in UTF-16 often begin with hexadecimal FE
      FF 00 3C 00 3F 00 78 00 6D 00 6C or FF FE 3C 00 3F 00 78 00 6D
      00 6C 00 (the Byte Order Mark (BOM) followed by "<?xml").  For
      more information, see Appendix F of [XML].

   File extension(s):  .xml

   Macintosh File Type Code(s):  "TEXT"

   Base URI:  See Section 6 of RFC7303

   Addresses section in RFC7303

Change controller:  The XML specification is a work product of the
   World Wide Web Consortium's XML Core Working Group.  The W3C has
   change control over RFC7303.
