this type registered.


MEDIA TYPE NAME:
application


MEDIA SUBTYPE NAME:
set-payment-initiation


PURPOSE:
This media subtype identifies a message that provides initialization
information prior to SET's payment sequence.  Payment is the process
by which funds are transfered in support of a purchase.


REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
none


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
none


ENCODING CONSIDERATIONS:

Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) messages are in a binary format,
using ASN.1 DER encoding as specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.690.
These encodings may include encrypted information which is itself
DER encoded.


SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

SET is designed so that all sensitive information is either encrypted
or blinded and as such secure communication channels are not required
for privacy reasons.  Although an eavesdropper observing SET messages
can perform basic traffic analysis, the security of financial and
and other private information is ensured through the use of encryption
privacy and digital signatures for authentication of origin and integrity
protection.  No SET message contains "executable" information of any kind.


PUBLISHED SPECIFICATION:

The published specification is available from either http://www.visa.com or
