MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.HandHeld-Entertainment+xml

Required parameters : None

Optional parameters : None

Encoding considerations : 8bit
This media type always uses the utf-8 charset.

Security considerations : The new MIME type does not contain any active or 
executable content. The new MIME type does not contain any personally 
identifiable information and therefore does not present a significant 
privacy risk. The content describes entertainment services, and therefore 
we believe integrity services are not needed. Assuming proper syntax errror 
handling and buffer handling techniques are employed when parsing the text 
file, we see no significant security risks.

Interoperability considerations :
System is designed to conform to Unix and Windows standards.

Published specification :
The proposal is not published at this time.

This application supercedes the previous application(s) from HandHeld
Entertainment.

Zvue.com is expected to be viewed from a Windows XP compatible browser,
especially Internet Explorer 6 or FireFox 1.5. The Web Store is responsible
for the complete online shopping experience, including browsing for media
from partner web sites, payment processing, selecting among alternate media
formats, and starting the download media process.

ZVUE Media Manager V2.0 is expected to download the purchased files and to
provide the user interface for viewing the local media and transferring the
media to the attached device.

Purchased audio and video will consist of one or more files which need to be
downloaded to the users PC. When more than one file makes up a purchased
item, all the files make up an atomic unit and must all be downloaded before
the media can be used. For example, a song might consist of an MP3 file,
and XML control file, and a JPEG album art image.

MIME Type

The web server will send the download control file as content-type:
application/zmm
