(RFC 3204 published December 2001, subtype last updated December 2001)

Media type name: application
Media subtype name: ISUP
Required parameters: version
Optional parameters: base
Encoding scheme: binary
Security considerations: See section 5.

The ISUP message is encapsulated beginning with the Message Type Code
(i.e., omitting Routing Label and Circuit ID Code).

The use of the 'version' parameter allows network administrators to
identify specific versions of ISUP that will be exchanged on a
bilateral basis. This enables a particular client such as a
SoftSwitch/Media Gateway Controller to recognize and parse the
message correctly, or (possibly) to reject the message if the
specified ISUP version is not supported. This specification places no
constraints on the values that may be used in 'version'; these are
left to the discretion of the network administrator.

This 'version' could, for example, be used to identify a network-
specific implementation of ISUP, e.g., X-NetxProprietaryISUPv3, or to
identify a well-known standard version of ISUP, e.g., itu-t or ansi.

A 'base' parameter can optionally be included in some cases (e.g., if
the receiver may not recognize the 'version' string) to specify that
the encapsulated ISUP can also be processed using the identified
'base' specification. Table 1 provides a list of 'base' values
supported by the 'application/ISUP' media type, including whether or
not the forward compatibility mechanism defined in ITU-T 1992 ISUP is
supported.

The Content-Disposition header [5] may be included to describe how
the encapsulated ISUP is to be processed, and in particular what the
handling should be if the received Content-Type is not recognized.
The default disposition-type for an ISUP message body is "signal".
This type indicates that the body part contains signaling information
associated with the session, but does not describe the session.

Supplementing the description of the Content-Disposition header in
[5], as well as any characterization of the Content-Disposition
header in the SIP standard, is the following BNF describing
disposition-types and disposition-params that may be used in the
header of ISUP and QSIG MIME bodies.

Content-Disposition = "Content-Disposition" ":"
disposition-type *( ";" disposition-param )
disposition-type = "signal" | disp-extension-token
disposition-param = "handling" "="
( "optional" | "required" | other-handling )
| generic-param
other-handling = token
disp-extension-token = token

A full definition of the use of the "handling" parameter is given in
the IANA Considerations section [in RFC 3204]. The following is how a
typical header would look ('base' may be omitted):

Content-Type: application/ISUP; version=nxv3; base=etsi121
Content-Disposition: signal; handling=optional
