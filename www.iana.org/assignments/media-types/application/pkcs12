Type name: application

Subtype name: pkcs12

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations:
PKCS #12 data typically contains one or more private keys encrypted
with a password using a key derivation function. Poor password
choices, weak algorithms, or improper parameter selections (e.g.,
insufficient salting rounds) will make the confidential payloads much
easier to compromise. Additionally, PFX was subject to criticism for
being too obtuse and cumbersome to implement (see Gutmann, P., PFX -
How Not to Design a Crypto Protocol/Standard,
<https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/pfx.html>). Many of these
(editorial) shortcomings have been addressed in the latest
publications of PKCS #12.

For further considerations, see Section 6 of RFC 7292.

Interoperability considerations:
PKCS #12 (formerly PFX, Personal Information Exchange) is a widely recognized format for exchange of secret (personal identity) information on all modern cryptographic stacks. The format is primarily used for the exchange of private keys and certificates, but can also be used to exchange symmetric keys, miscellaneous secrets, attributed objects, and extensions.

Published specification:
PKCS #12 v1.0, June 1999; PKCS #12 v1.1 (RFC 7292), July 2014

Applications that use this media type:
Machines, applications, browsers, Internet kiosks, and so on, that support this standard allow a user to import, export, and exercise a single set of personal identity information.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A
