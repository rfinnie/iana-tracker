(RFC 3902 published September 2004, subtype last updated September 2004)

MIME media type name: application
MIME subtype name: soap+xml
Required parameters: none
Optional parameters:

   "charset": This parameter has identical semantics to the charset
      parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in
      RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

   "action": This optional parameter can be used to specify the URI
      that identifies the intent of the message.  In SOAP 1.2, it
      serves a similar purpose as the SOAPAction HTTP header field
      did in SOAP 1.1.  Namely, its value identifies the intent of
      the message.

      The value of the action parameter is an absolute URI-reference
      as defined by RFC 2396 [RFC2396], which MUST be non-empty.
      SOAP places no restrictions on the specificity of the URI or
      that it is resolvable.  Although the purpose of the action
      parameter is to indicate the intent of the SOAP message there
      is no mechanism for automatically computing the value based on
      the SOAP envelope.  In other words, the value has to be
      determined out of band.  It is recommended that the same value
      be used to identify sets of message types that are logically
      connected in some manner, for example part of the same
      "service".  It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the URI be globally
      unique and stable over time.

      Use of the action parameter is OPTIONAL.  SOAP Receivers MAY
      use it as a hint to optimize processing, but SHOULD NOT require
      its presence in order to operate.

Encoding considerations: Identical to those of "application/xml" as
   described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 3.2, as applied to the
   SOAP envelope infoset.

Security considerations: Because SOAP can carry application defined
   data whose semantics is independent from that of any MIME wrapper
   (or context within which the MIME wrapper is used), one should not
   expect to be able to understand the semantics of the SOAP message
   based on the semantics of the MIME wrapper alone.  Therefore,
   whenever using the "application/soap+xml" media type, it is
   strongly RECOMMENDED that the security implications of the context
   within which the SOAP message is used is fully understood.  The
   security implications are likely to involve both the specific SOAP
   binding to an underlying protocol as well as the application-
   defined semantics of the data carried in the SOAP message (though
   one must be careful when doing this, as discussed in SOAP 1.2 Part
   1 [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624], section Binding to
   Application-Specific Protocols).

   Also, see SOAP 1.2 Part 1 [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624], the
   entire section Security Considerations.

   In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it
   shares the same security considerations as described in RFC 3023
   [RFC3023], section 10.

   The action parameter is not a security mechanism, and SHOULD NOT
   be used for authentication.  If the action parameter is used to
   make decisions (e.g., dispatch, filtering), it is RECOMMENDED that
   the basis for such decisions should be confirmed by examining the
   SOAP Envelope.

Interoperability considerations: There are no known interoperability
   issues.

Published specification: SOAP 1.2 Part 1
   [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624] and SOAP 1.2 Part 2
   [W3C.REC-soap12-part2-20030624].

Applications which use this media type: Various SOAP 1.2 conformant
   toolkits use this media type.

Additional information:
File extension: SOAP messages are not required or expected to be
   stored as files.
Fragment identifiers: Identical to that of "application/xml" as
   described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 5.
Base URI: As specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 6.  Also see
   SOAP 1.2 Part 1 [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624], section Use of
   URIs in SOAP.
