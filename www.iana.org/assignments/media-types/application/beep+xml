(RFC 3080 published March 2001, subtype last updated March 2001)

MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: beep+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: charset (defaults to "UTF-8" [13])

Encoding considerations: This media type may contain binary content;
   accordingly, when used over a transport that does not permit
   binary transfer, an appropriate encoding must be applied

Security considerations: none, per se; however, any BEEP profile
   which uses this media type must describe its relevant security
   considerations

Interoperability considerations: n/a

Published specification: This media type is a proper subset of the
   the XML 1.0 specification [2].  Two restrictions are made.

   First, no entity references other than the five predefined general
   entities references ("&amp;", "&lt;", "&gt;", "&apos;", and
   "&quot;") and numeric entity references may be present.

   Second, neither the "XML" declaration (e.g., <?xml version="1.0"
   ?>) nor the "DOCTYPE" declaration (e.g., <!DOCTYPE ...>) may be
   present.  (Accordingly, if another character set other than UTF-8
   is desired, then the "charset" parameter must be present.)

   All other XML 1.0 instructions (e.g., CDATA blocks, processing
   instructions, and so on) are allowed.

Applications which use this media type: any BEEP profile wishing to
   make use of this XML 1.0 subset
