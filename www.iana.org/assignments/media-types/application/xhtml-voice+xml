MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: xhtml-voice+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:

  charset:  has the same semantics as the charset parameter of the
            "application/xml" media type specified in [RFC3023].

Encoding considerations:  
            XHTML+Voice has the same media type encoding
            considerations specified in section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

Security considerations:

XHTML+Voice is an extension of XHTML and has the same security issues
as XHTML.  These include interpreting anchors and forms in XHTML
documents, and scripting languages and other dynamic interactive
capabilities.  See section 7 of [RFC3236].

In addition, the scripting language can be accessed by both the XHTML
and the VoiceXML 2.0 markup embedded in the XHTML+Voice document.
See section 1.3.1.5 of [XPLUSV12].

XML-Events [XMLEVNTS] allows an author to attach a handler to any
node in the document.  The handler that is activated in response to a
specified event may be either a voice dialog or a script that can be
either in the same or an external document.

Interoperability considerations :

Because XHTML+Voice is built upon W3C standard recommendations, it is
designed to be interoperable across a wide range of platforms and
client devices.  Because the extensions to XHTML are identified by
their namespaces, all browsers that have namespace support can run an
XHTML+Voice document as an XHTML document without voice interaction.
   
Published specification:

   The latest published version of XHTML+Voice is [XPLUSV12].

Applications which use this media type:

   XHTML+Voice documents are intended to be deployed on the World
   Wide Web and rendered by multimodal browsers that support the
   visual and voice modes of interaction.  Because XHTML+Voice is
   an application of XML, authors can expect XHTML+Voice user
   agents to be conformant XML 1.0 [XML] processors.  See section
   2 of [RFC3236].
