Security considerations : 
ACU files are machine independent COBOL objects. When executed using
the ACUCOBOL-GT runtime, they have access to all of the local and
network resources that are allowed by the operating system for the
user. ACU files from an unknown source should never be considered as
trusted applications.

Interoperability considerations : 
ACU files are interpreted by the ACUCOBOL-GT runtime. The ACUCOBOL-GT
runtime is currently available on over 600 different platforms. It has
been ported to MS-DOS, 16 bit Windows, 32 bit Windows (95 and NT),
OS/2, Unix, VMS, AMOS, and AOS/VS operating systems.
