MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.gmx

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters : none

Encoding considerations : binary
This media type may require encoding on transports not capable of
handling binary.

Security considerations :
GmX uses a system whereby the downloaded content is executed on the
client machine through an interpreter (and possibly a sandbox). The
content is not signed, but contains information about the
creator/sender. As a security precaution, the user must accept the
execution of such caution except when the content is being download
from a secure site or trusted source. Even though there are many
security precautions enabled by default, the user may change or
disable any of them easily.
The sender related information is classified and doesn't actually
determine information about the sender except IP information and IP
type (static or dynamic).
As a concealment of this information and protection, the content is
encrypted on a secure server which users only have preprocess upload
and postprocess download access.

Interoperability considerations :
Non applicable - At the moment the runner/interpreter which executes
the content is a trade secret not controlled by us (developers of
GmX). As to cross platform, it is possible for different operating
systems but not at the moment.
