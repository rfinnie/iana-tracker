Type name: application

Subtype name: efi

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: EFI files contains native code that executes in the pre-boot environment at the firmware privilege. Extreme caution is advised.

EFI files support digital signatures providing strong integrity protection using UEFI Secure Boot. Basic checksums are also supported.

The EFI format does not provide any confidentiality protection of its own and requires external means if that is required.

The EFI format does not use compression.

EFI files allow for runtime generation of additional code.

Interoperability considerations: EFI binaries follow the PE-COFF standard image format, and require a UEFI compliant firmware for proper execution. The EFI file format is also dependent on the target processor architecture.
