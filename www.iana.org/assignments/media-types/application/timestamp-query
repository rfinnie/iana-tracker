(RFC 3161 published August 2001, subtype last updated April August 2001)

This section specifies a means for conveying ASN.1-encoded messages
for the protocol exchanges described in Section 2 and Appendix D via
Internet mail.

Two MIME objects are specified as follows:

Content-Type: application/timestamp-query
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
<<the ASN.1 DER-encoded Time-Stamp message, base64-encoded>>

Content-Type: application/timestamp-reply
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
<<the ASN.1 DER-encoded Time-Stamp message, base64-encoded>>

These MIME objects can be respectively sent and received using common
MIME processing engines and provides a simple Internet mail transport
for Time-Stamp messages.

For the application/timestamp-query and application/timestamp-reply
MIME types, implementations SHOULD include the optional "name" and
"filename" parameters.  Including a file name helps preserve type
information when time-stamp queries and replies are saved as files.
When these parameters are included, a file name with the appropriate
extension SHOULD be selected:

        MIME Type                     File Extension
   application/timestamp-query            .TSQ
   application/timestamp-reply            .TSR

In addition, the file name SHOULD be limited to eight characters
followed by a three letter extension.  The eight character filename
base can be any distinct name.
