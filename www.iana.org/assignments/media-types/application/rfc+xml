(registered via RFC-iab-xml2rfcv2-02)

Type name:  application

Subtype name:  rfc+xml

Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
   semantics to the charset parameter of the "application/xml" Media
   Type specified in Section 9.1 of [RFC7303].

Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
   described in Section 9.1 of [RFC7303].

Security considerations:  As defined in Section 7.  In addition, as
   this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
   security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC7303].

Interoperability considerations:  Some aspects of this vocabulary
   currently cannot be used interoperably; among the reasons for this
   are that they weren't precisely defined in the first place, that
   they have been added in an ad hoc fashion later on, or that they
   are specific to certain output formats.  This specification
   attempts to identify these cases in the description of the
   individual elements/attributes.

Published specification:  [RFC-iab-xml2rfcv2-02].

Applications that use this media type:  Applications that transform
   xml2rfc to output formats such as plain text or HTML, plus
   additional analysis tools.

Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
   for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be used as
   shorthand pointers, as described in Section 3.2 of 
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xptr-framework-20030325/.
