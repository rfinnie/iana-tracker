MIME media type name:  application

MIME subtype name:  EmergencyCallData.Control+xml

Mandatory parameters:  none

Optional parameters:  charset

   Indicates the character encoding of the XML content.

Encoding considerations:
   Uses XML, which can employ 8-bit characters, depending on the
   character encoding used.  See Section 3.2 of RFC 7303
   [RFC7303].

Security considerations:
   This media type carries metadata and control information and
   requests, such as from a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)
   to an In-Vehicle System (IVS) during an emergency call.

   Metadata (such as an acknowledgment that data sent by the IVS
   to the PSAP was successfully received) has limited privacy and
   security implications.  Control information (such as requests
   from the PSAP that the vehicle perform an action) has some
   privacy and security implications.  The privacy concern arises
   from the ability to request the vehicle to transmit a data set,
   which as described in Section 14.3 can contain personal
   information.  The security concern is the ability to request
   the vehicle to perform an action.  Control information needs to
   originate only from a PSAP or other emergency services
   providers and not be modified en route.  The level of integrity
   of the cellular network over which the emergency call is placed
   is a consideration: when the IVS initiates an eCall over a
   cellular network, in most cases it relies on the MNO to route
   the call to a PSAP.  (Calls placed using other means, such as
   Wi-Fi or over-the-top services, generally incur somewhat higher
   levels of risk than calls placed "natively" using cellular
   networks.)  A callback from a PSAP merits additional
   consideration, since current mechanisms are not ideal for
   verifying that such a call is indeed a callback from a PSAP in
   response to an emergency call placed by the IVS.  See the
   discussion in Section 11 and the PSAP Callback document
   [RFC7090].

   Sections 7 and 8 of [RFC7852] contain more discussion.
