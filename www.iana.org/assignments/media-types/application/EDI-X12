(RFC 1767 published March 1995, subtype last updated March 1995)

MIME type name:               Application

MIME subtype name:            EDI-X12

Required parameters:          none

Optional parameters:          CHARSET, as defined for MIME

Encoding considerations:      May need BASE64 or QUOTED-PRINTABLE
                              transfer encoding

Security considerations:      See separate section in the
                              document.

Published specification:      Contained in the following section.

Rationale:                    The ASC X12 EDI specifications are
                              accepted standards for a class of
                              inter-organization transactions;
                              this permits their transmission
                              over the Internet, via email.

Detail specific to MIME-based usage:

     This is a generic mechanism for sending any ASC X12
     interchange.  The object is self-defining, in terms of
     indicating which specific EDI objects are included.  Most
     EDI data is textual, but special characters such as some
     delimiters may be non-printable ASCII or some data may be
     pure binary.  For EDI objects containing such data, the MIME
     transfer mechanism may need to encode the object in Content-
     Transfer-Encoding:quoted-printable or base64.
