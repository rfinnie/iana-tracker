Encoding considerations: MARC records may contain long lines and/or
arbitrary octet values. The base64 content-transfer-encoding is
recommended for transmission of MARC over electronic mail.

Security Considerations

There are no known security risks associated with the use or viewing
of MARC data. A MARC record may have security classification
associated with the document it describes or metadata in that record.
Although this does not present any security risk to the user of MARC
data, it may provide an opportunity for a security breach for the
source of classified MARC data.

Interoperability Considerations

MARC is a communication format and is designed for interoperability
between different systems that may store data in local formats
internally.
