Encoding considerations: 8bit

Security considerations: This media type represents very simple 
   markup documents called Frogans short-cuts. These documents only 
   contain a Frogans address and they are specified in version 2.1 of
   the Frogans Slide Description Language (FSDL) technical 
   specification 
   (https://www.frogans.org/en/resources/fsdl/access.html). There are
   no security issues associated with this type. This media type 
   represents no executable content and does not require integrity or
   confidentiality protection.

Interoperability considerations: This type is interoperable on any 
   system.

Published specification: The specification of this type is included 
   in version 2.1 of the Frogans Slide Description Language (FSDL) 
   technical specification 
   (https://www.frogans.org/en/resources/fsdl/access.html).

Applications which use this media:
   - on the client side: some old versions of Frogans Player
   - on the server side: HTTP servers

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: N/A

General Comments: Frogans is a medium for publishing content and 
   services on the Internet. From its inception in 1999, the medium 
   was designed as a generic software layer running on top of the 
   original Internet infrastructure (i.e., the TCP and IP protocols 
   and the Domain Name System (DNS)), alongside other existing layers
   such as E-mail or the World Wide Web. The Frogans Slide 
   Description Language (FSDL) is an XML-based markup language used 
   to create and publish Frogans sites on the Internet. The 
   'leaptofrogans' URI scheme is a mechanism enabling end-user 
   applications, such as Web browsers or E-mail clients, to launch 
   Frogans Player on a given Frogans site. The official Web site of 
   the Frogans technology is https://www.frogans.org/

Intended usage: Obsolete

   This type was used for the distribution of Frogans short-cuts on 
   the Internet. It was registered in 2006 to work with version 2.1 
   of the Frogans Slide Description Language (FSDL) technical 
   specification. This type is no longer used as of version 3.0 of 
   the FSDL technical specification 
   (https://www.frogans.org/en/resources/fsdl/access.html) and has 
   been replaced by another mechanism, namely the 'leaptofrogans' URI
   scheme, which contains a Frogans address and is described in RFC 
   8589 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8589).

   The use of a media type for the distribution of Frogans short-cuts 
   on the Internet was determined to be unsatisfactory for the 
   reasons described in section 2 of RFC 8589. For example, using a 
   media type from a Web page to launch another application did not 
   always work, especially on mobile devices.
