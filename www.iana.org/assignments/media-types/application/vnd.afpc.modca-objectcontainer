MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: vnd.afpc.modca-objectcontainer

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary (framed transport)

   Being an object inside of the AFP MO:DCA specification, an object 
   container is an envelope for object data. The object data may or 
   may not be defined by an AFP architecture. Therefore the data is 
   binary data. The recommended content-transfer-encoding is "base64".

Security considerations: Object Container are part of MO:DCA, which 
   is an architected specification of final-form presentation data. 
   It is not a programming language, does not contain any file 
   operators, and therefore cannot corrupt a receiver's file system 
   or programming environment. It does not allow executable content 
   or calls to external applications.

   The format does not provide integrity or privacy protection in 
   itself. Integrity on file level could be ensured by means external
   to the specification.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: As part of "MO:DCA Reference (Mixed Object 
   Document Content Architecture Reference)", AFP Consortium 
   publication AFPC-0004-09.

Application usage: An object container is a MO:DCA object which is an
   envelope for object data. The object data may or may not be 
   defined by an AFP architecture, e.g. a TIFF image object.

   Used in Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) generators and 
   consumers. A wide variety of applications are created by members 
   of the AFP Consortium and other parties.

Fragment Identifier Considerations: N/A

Restrictions in Usage: This format is mostly used in applications 
   around high speed transactional printing.
