MIME media type name : application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree (grandfathered name) - rtf

Required parameters : None

Optional parameters : None

 Note: RTF specifies its own character set internally for its text data,
 thus having a charset parameter would be redundant.

Encoding considerations : binary

 This media type may require encoding on transports not capable of
 handling binary data.

 Prior to version 1.5 textual content in RTF was 7bit only. 1.5 changed this
 to allow  unencoded 8bit characters. However, since RTF allows inclusion
 of binary data in <pict> elements, binary encoding may have to be used for
 object of type application/rtf.

Security considerations :

 RTF content consists of unformatted text and control words. Executable
 content is not allowed. RTF provides no integrity or confidentiality services
 internally so external signature and encryption services must be used to
 protect sensitive content.

 RTF supports references to external files and other objects. Care should
 be taken when resolving such references in order not to violate
 security policies.

Interoperability considerations :
