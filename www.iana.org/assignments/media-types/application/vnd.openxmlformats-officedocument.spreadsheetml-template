MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree -
vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.template

Required parameters : None.

Optional parameters :
None.

Encoding considerations : binary


Security considerations :
This subtype is intended for an OOXML document of the category
Spreadsheet. It is a ZIP package containing OPC parts, some of
which are XML documents.

An OOXML document of this subtype does not contain macros. Other
media types are expected to be registered for those which do. For
example, vnd.ms-excel.template.macroEnabled.12 has already been
registered for those which contain Microsoft macros. Note that
different file extensions are used depending on whether OOXML
documents contain macros. For example, &quot;xltx&quot; is used for
macro-free
spreadsheet templates, while &quot;xltm&quot; is used for macro-enabled
spreadsheet templates.

An OOXML document of this subtype may contain an Active-X control only
when an OPC part of type application/vnd.ms-office.activeX+xml exists
within this OOXML document.

An OOXML document of this subtype may contain executable contents
other than macros or Active-X controls, since the the underlying technology,
namely ISO/IEC 29500-2 (Open Packaging Convention) and ZIP, allow
such contents. However, such executable contents are beyond
ISO/IEC 29500-1 (Fundamentals and Markup Language Reference) and
ISO/IEC 29500-4 (Transitional Migration Features). Such executable
contents are not invoked by MS Office and similar office suites.

An OOXML document of this subtype may contain personal information,
but cannnot be encrypted. In other words, ISO/IEC 29500 or Ecma-376
do not provide any mechanisms for encryption. OOXML documents
encrypted by mechanisms beyond ISO/IEC 29500 are not of this subtype.

An OOXML document of this subtype may contain a digital signature, as
specified in ISO/IEC 29500-2.
