Type name: application

Subtype name: ogg

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: codecs, whose syntax is defined in RFC 4281.
See section 4 of RFC 5334 for a list of allowed values.

Encoding considerations: See section 6 of RFC 5334.

Security considerations: See section 7 of RFC 5334.

Applications which use this media type: Scientific and otherwise that
require various multiplexed signals or streams of data, with or
without scriptable control of content.

Additional information:

Magic number(s): The first four bytes, 0x4f 0x67 0x67 0x53,
correspond to the string "OggS".

File extension(s): .ogx

   RFC 3534 defined the file extension .ogg for application/ogg,
   which RFC 5334 obsoletes in favor of .ogx due to concerns where,
   historically, some implementations expect .ogg files to be solely
   Vorbis-encoded audio.

Macintosh File Type Code(s): OggX

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: The type application/ogg SHOULD only be used
in situations where it is not appropriate to serve data under the
video/ogg or audio/ogg types.  Data served under the application/ogg
type SHOULD use the .ogx file extension and MUST contain an Ogg
Skeleton logical bitstream to identify all other contained logical
bitstreams.
