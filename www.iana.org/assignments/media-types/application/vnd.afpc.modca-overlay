MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: vnd.afpc.modca-overlay

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

   Being an object inside of the AFP MO:DCA specification, an overlay
   carries text, image, bar code, and graphics data objects,
   therefore the data is a mixture of binary data and character data.
   The recommended content-transfer-encoding is "base64".

Security considerations: Overlays are part of MO:DCA, which is an 
   architected specification of final-form presentation data. 
   Overlays inherit the security considerations of the MO:DCA format 
   as a whole.

   It is not a programming language, does not contain any file 
   operators, and therefore cannot corrupt a receiver's file system 
   or programming environment. It does not allow executable content 
   or calls to external applications.

   The format does not provide integrity or privacy protection in 
   itself. Integrity on file level could be ensured by means external
   to the specification. As Overlays can contain graphics in various 
   other formats, the security considerations of those formats also 
   apply.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: As part of "MO:DCA Reference (Mixed Object
   Document Content Architecture Reference)", AFP Consortium
   publication AFPC-0004-09.

Application usage: An overlay is a MO:DCA resource object. An overlay
   is similar to a page in that it defines its own environment and
   carries the same data objects.

   Used in Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) generators and
   consumers. A wide variety of applications are created by members
   of the AFP Consortium and other parties.

Fragment Identifier Considerations: N/A

Restrictions in Usage: This format is mostly used in applications
   around high speed transactional printing.

Additional information:

   Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A

   Magic number(s): Any object in the AFP specification has a byte 
      pattern that opens and closes the object. For Overlays the 
      sequence of bytes is:

      0xD3A8DF - Begin Overlay (BMO) Structured Field
      ... <object data>
      0xD3A9DF - End Overlay (EMO) Structured Field

      As Overlays contain other AFP objects, the opening and closing 
      byte patterns of the included objects can be checked 
      respectively. Please see the relevant parts of the 
      specification that describe the respective object types.
   
   File extension(s): ovl
   
   Macintosh File Type Code(s): N/A
   
   Object Identifiers: none

Intended usage: Limited use

Overlays as part of MO:DCA data is application output to be
   presented on screen or paper.
