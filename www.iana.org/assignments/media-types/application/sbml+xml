(RFC 3823 published June 2004, subtype last updated June 2004)

MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: sbml+xml

Required parameters: none.

Optional parameters: none.

   There is no charset parameter.  Character handling has identical
   semantics to the case where the charset parameter of the
   "application/xml" media type is omitted, as described in section
   3.2 of [RFC3023].  Note that SBML level 2 is defined to have UTF-8
   encoding [SBML2-1, section 4.1].

Encoding considerations:

   Same as described in section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

Security considerations:

   The security considerations described in section 7 of [RFC3470]
   all potentially apply to sbml+xml documents.  In particular,
   sbml+xml documents might contain the results of proprietary
   biological research that their owner may wish to keep private.

The XML schema for sbml+xml provides for no active or executable
content.

Interoperability considerations:

   The information in an sbml+xml document describes an abstract
   model of biochemical reactions.  It is not tied to any particular
   software application, and indeed the primary purpose of SBML is to
   make these models readable and writable by many different software
   applications.

   This might seem to make sbml+xml more appropriate for the "Model"
   primary content type [RFC2077], but SBML models are not guaranteed
   to have the required three orthogonal dimensions.  SBML models,
   rather, involve interacting entities that exist within
   compartments.  However, ideally, browsers and other software that
   reads sbml+xml would give a human reader multiple choices of how
   to view the document: in a data-visualization tool, in a model
   editor, in a differential-equation analyzer, etc.

   The systems biology community has and will continue to release new
   levels and versions of the SBML schema and semantics.  New
   versions attempt to be backward compatible with old versions, but
   sometimes small incompatibilities are introduced.  Every sbml+xml
   document contains its level and version; programs that read
   sbml+xml should read this information to be sure they correctly
   interpret the remainder of the document.

Applications which use this media type:

   The following application and database projects read and/or write
   models in sbml+xml format.  Currently, most do not encode or
   decode MIME-format messages.  Hopefully the registration of
   sbml+xml will make it easier for these projects to connect through
   a broader infrastructure, such as the creation of repositories of
   models on the world-wide web.

   over the specification.

   The SBML Team and interested members of the systems biology
   community meet regularly at the "Workshops on Software Platforms
   for Systems Biology".  Information about past and planned
