Media type name: application

Subtype name: vnd.afpc.cmoca-cmresource

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: Color Management Resources are part of 
   MO:DCA, which is an architected specification of final-form 
   presentation data. It is not a programming language, does not 
   contain any file operators, and therefore cannot corrupt a 
   receiver's file system or programming environment. It does not 
   allow executable content or calls to external applications.

   The format does not provide integrity or privacy protection in 
   itself. If privacy or integrity protection is needed it must be 
   provided by external means.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: As part of "CMOCA Reference (Color 
   Management Object Content Architecture Reference)", AFP Consortium 
   publication AFPC-0006-01.

Application usage: A color management resource (CMR) is an 
   architected resource that is used to carry the color management 
   information required to render a print file, document, page, or 
   data object. Each CMR carries a single type of color management 
   resource.

   Used in Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) generators and 
   consumers. A wide variety of applications are created by members 
   of the AFP Consortium and other parties.

Fragment Identifier Considerations: N/A

Restrictions in Usage: This format is mostly used in applications
   around high speed transactional printing.

   Magic number(s): Like any other AFP object, Color Management 
      Resources are enclosed with a "Begin" and an "End" structured 
      field. A Color Management Resource is an object container and 
      starts with the sequence:

      0xD3A892 - Begin Object Container (BOC) Structured Field
      
      and it ends with the sequence:
      
      0xD3A992 - End Object Container (EOC) Structured Field

   File extension(s): N/A

   Macintosh File Type Code(s): N/A

   Color Management Resources as part of MO:DCA data is application 
   output to be presented on screen or paper.
