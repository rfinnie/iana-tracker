      (If the above is not an existing top-level MIME type,

      MIME subtype name: vnd.fdf

        A Content-Type of "application/vnd.fdf" indicates a document in
        Forms Data Format.  The Forms Data Format (FDF) is described in an

        Adobe Systems Technical Note [FDF].

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters: none

      Encoding considerations: FDF files may contain binary data (either
        in strings or in streams (which are used to represent images
        among other things).

      Security considerations:

        There are not security considerations for an FDF as documented in
        the specification [FDF]. FDF is extensible, however, and is capable
        of carrying other file formats. Such extensions could be executable,
        for example, JAVA applets, which may have security considerations.

      Published specification:

        [FDF]: Forms Data Format Specification, Technical Note 5173
        Adobe Systems, Inc, 1996.
