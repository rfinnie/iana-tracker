MIME media type name:
Application

MIME subtype name:
3gpp-ims+xml

Required parameters:
None

Optional parameters: 
"charset"   the parameter has identical semantics to the charset
parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in RFC 3023.

"sv" or "schemaversion" the parameter's value is used to indicate:
 - the versions of the 3GPP IP multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN)
Subsystem XML schema that can be
   used to validate the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML body (if the MIME
   type and parameter are present in the Content-Type header) or
 - the accepted versions of the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem XML body (if the
   MIME type and parameter are present in the Accept header).

If the "sv" and schemaversion" parameters are absent, it shall be
   assumed that version 1 of the XML Schema for the IM CN subsystem
   XML body is supported.

Encoding considerations:
Same as encoding considerations of application/xml as specified in RFC
   3023

Security considerations:
Same as general security considerations for application/xml as
   specified in section 10 of RFC 3023.
In addition, this content type provides a format for exchanging
information in SIP, so the security considerations from RFC 3261 apply.

Interoperability considerations:
Same as Interoperability considerations as specified in section 3.1 of
RFC 3023.
If both "sv" and "schemaversion" are specified, than the value of
"schemaversion" MUST be ignored

Published specification:
3GPP TS 24.229 version 8.4.1: "IP multimedia call control protocol
   based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description
   Protocol (SDP), stage 3"
