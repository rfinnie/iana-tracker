(the "Unsealer") which makes the unencrypted content available in a 
very limited fashion to a user's system. As the data format is 
private and encrypted using well-known algorithms, it is unlikely 
that the data could be spoofed. The client is also designed to 
refuse to work with data that is corrupt or ill-formed. This data 
does not contain any executable material.

Interoperability considerations :
This mime-type is valid for Windows systems only.

The specifications for this content-type are proprietary. They
are specified by Sealed Media. The registration of this content-

proprietary data type within the MIME/HTTP environment and does not 
specify any details about the content format or semantics, except 
to refer to the software and specifications provided by Sealed Media.
