(RFC 3204 published December 2001, subtype last updated December 2001)

Media type name: application
Media subtype name: QSIG
Required parameters: none
Optional parameters: version
Encoding scheme: binary
Security considerations: See section 5.

The use of the 'version' parameter allows identification of different
QSIG variants. This enables the terminating Connection Server to
recognize and parse the message correctly, or (possibly) to reject
the message if the particular QSIG variant is not supported.

Table 2 is a list of protocol versions supported by the
'application/QSIG' media type.

        Table 2: QSIG versions

      version         protocol
      -------         --------
      iso             ISO/IEC 11572 (Basic Call) and
                      ISO/IEC 11582 (Generic Functional Protocol)

The following is how a typical header would look (Content-Disposition
not included in this instance):

   Content-Type: application/QSIG; version=iso

The default Content-Disposition disposition-type is "signal" as in an
ISUP body part. The "handling" parameter described above can also be
used for QSIG bodies.
