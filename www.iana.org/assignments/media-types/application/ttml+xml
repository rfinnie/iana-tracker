MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - ttml+xml

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters :
charset
If specified, the charset parameter must match the XML encoding declaration. 
See Encoding Considerations below. It is thus constrained to either UTF-8 or 
UTF-16. When charset is not specified, the default value is the actual encoding. 

profile
The document profile of a TTMLDocument Instance may be specified using an 
optional profile parameter, which, if specified, the value of which must adhere 
to the syntax and semantics of ttp:profile parameter defined by Section 6.2.8 
ttp:profile [1] of the published specification.

Encoding considerations: binary

Encoding considerations for this type are the same as for application/xml, 
except constrained to either UTF-8 or UTF-16. See [XML Media Types] 
(http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt), Section 3.2 or its successor(s) if 
appropriate for additional guidance.

Security considerations :
As with other XML types and as noted in [XML Media Types] 
(http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt), Section 10, repeated expansion of 
maliciously constructed XML entities can be used to consume large amounts of 
memory, which may cause XML processors in constrained environments to fail.

In addition, because of the extensibility features for TTML and of XML in 
general, it is possible that "application/ttml+xml" may describe content that 
has security implications beyond those described here. However, TTML does not 
provide for any sort of active or executable content, and if the processor 
follows only the normative semantics of the published specification, this 
content will be outside TTML namespaces and may be ignored. Only in the case 
where the processor recognizes and processes the additional content, or where 
further processing of that content is dispatched to other processors, would 
security issues potentially arise. And in that case, they would fall outside 
the domain of this registration document.

Although not prohibited, there are no expectations that XML signatures or 
encryption would normally be employed.


Interoperability considerations :


Published specification :
This media type registration is extracted from Appendix C Media Type 
Registration of the Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) 1.0 specification:
http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/
Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) 1.0.


Applications which use this media :
TTML is used in the television industry for the purpose of authoring, 
transcoding and exchanging timed text information and for delivering captions, 
subtitles, and other metadata for television material repurposed for the Web 
or, more generally, the Internet.

There is partial and full support of TTML in components used by several Web 
browsers plugins, and in a number of caption authoring tools.


Additional information :

1. Magic number(s) : none
2. File extension(s) : .ttml
3. Macintosh file type code : "TTML"
4. Object Identifiers: none

Encoding Considerations:
Same for application/xml, except constrained to either UTF-8 or UTF-16. See 
[XML Media Types] (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt), Section 3.2.

Fragment identifiers:

For documents labeled as application/ttml+xml, the fragment identifier notation 
is intended to be used with xml:id attributes, as described in section 7.2.1 of 
the Timed Text Markup Language 1 (TTML1) specification [1].
