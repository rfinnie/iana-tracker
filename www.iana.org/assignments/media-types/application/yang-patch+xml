Type name: application

Subtype name: yang-patch+xml

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: 8-bit
   The "utf-8" charset is always used for this type.
   Each conceptual YANG data node is encoded according to the
   XML Encoding Rules and Canonical Format for the specific
   YANG data node type defined in [RFC7950].
   In addition, the "yang-patch" YANG Patch template found
   in [RFC8072] defines the structure of a YANG
   Patch request.

Security considerations: Security considerations related
   to the generation and consumption of RESTCONF messages
   are discussed in Section 5 of [RFC8072].
   Additional security considerations are specific to the
   semantics of particular YANG data models. Each YANG module
   is expected to specify security considerations for the
   YANG data defined in that module.

Interoperability considerations: [RFC8072] 
   specifies the format of conforming messages and the interpretation 
   thereof.

Published specification: RFC8072

Applications that use this media type: Instance document
  data parsers used within a protocol or automation tool
  that utilize the YANG Patch data structure.

Fragment identifier considerations: The syntax and semantics
   of fragment identifiers are the same as the syntax and semantics
   specified for the "application/xml" media type.
