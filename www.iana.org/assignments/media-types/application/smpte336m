(RFC 6597 published April 2012, subtype last updated April 2012)   

Type name: application

Subtype name: smpte336m

Required parameters:

   rate: RTP timestamp clock rate.  Typically chosen based on
      sampling rate of metadata being transmitted, but other rates
      can be specified.

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: This media type is framed and binary; see
   Section 4.8 of [RFC4288].

Security considerations: See Section 8 of RFC 6597.

Interoperability considerations: Data items in smpte336m can be very
   diverse.  Receivers might only be capable of interpreting a subset
   of the possible data items; unrecognized items are skipped.
   Agreement on data items to be used out of band, via application
   profile or similar, is typical.

Published specification: RFC 6597

Applications that use this media type: Streaming of metadata
   associated with simultaneously streamed video and transmission of
   [SMPTE-ST336]-based media formats (e.g., Material Exchange Format
   (MXF) [SMPTE-ST377]).

Additional Information: none

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: This media type depends on RTP framing, and
   hence is only defined for transfer via RTP ([RFC3550]).  Transport
   within other framing protocols is not defined at this time.
