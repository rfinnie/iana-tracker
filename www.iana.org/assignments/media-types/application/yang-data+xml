Type name: application

Subtype name: yang-data+xml

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: 8-bit
   Each conceptual YANG data node is encoded according to the
   XML Encoding Rules and Canonical Format for the specific
   YANG data node type defined in [RFC7950].

Security considerations: Security considerations related
   to the generation and consumption of RESTCONF messages
   are discussed in Section 12 of RFC 8040.
   Additional security considerations are specific to the
   semantics of particular YANG data models.  Each YANG module
   is expected to specify security considerations for the
   YANG data defined in that module.

Interoperability considerations: RFC 8040 specifies the
   format of conforming messages and the interpretation
   thereof.

Published specification: RFC 8040

Applications that use this media type: Instance document
   data parsers used within a protocol or automation tool
   that utilize YANG-defined data structures.

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identifiers for
   this type are not defined.  All YANG data nodes are
   accessible as resources using the path in the request URI.
