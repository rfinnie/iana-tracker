Name : Robin Berjon

Email : robin&w3.org

MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - xhtml+xml

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters :

charset: same as for application/xml [RFC7303]

profile: deprecated as the notion of XHTML profiles has been obsoleted 
in HTML5. See section 8 of RFC 3236 for additional information about how 
this parameter was defined.

Encoding considerations : binary

Security considerations :
The considerations for "text/html" as specified in 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html and for 'application/xml' as specified in [RFC 
7303], also hold for 'application/xhtml+xml'.

Interoperability considerations :
Rules for processing both conforming and non-conforming content are 
defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/html.


Published specification :
Labeling a resource with the application/xhtml+xml type asserts that the 
resource is an XML document that likely has a root element from the HTML 
namespace. Thus, the relevant specifications are the XML specification, 
the Namespaces in XML specification, and http://www.w3.org/TR/html.

Applications which use this media :
Web browsers, tools for processing Web content, HTML authoring tools, 
search engines, validators.

Fragment identifier considerations :
Same as for application/xml [RFC7303]

Restrictions on usage :
No restrictions apply.

Provisional registration? (standards tree only) :
No.
