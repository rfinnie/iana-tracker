MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: font-tdpfr

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: Binary or base 64 required

Security considerations:

PFR uses a structure that can store glyph image data and encoding
arrays. The fields defined in the PFR specification are of a
descriptive nature and provide information that is useful to
facilitate viewing and rendering of glyph images by a recipient.
As such, the fields currently defined in the PFR specification do
not in themselves create additional security risks, since the
fields are not used to induce any particular behavior by the
recipient application.

PFR has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically
possible that fields could be defined in the future which could be
used to induce particular actions on the part of the recipient,
thus presenting additional security risks, but this type of
capability is not supported in the referenced PFR specification.
Indeed, the definition of fields that would include such
processing instructions is inconsistent with the goals and spirit
of the PFR specification.

Interoperability considerations: none
