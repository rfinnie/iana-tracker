Type name: application

Subtype name: provenance+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: Same as charset parameter of application/xml as
specified in RFC3023 (Section 3.2).

Encoding considerations: Same as encoding considerations of
application/xml as specified in RFC 3023 (Section 3.2).

Security considerations: PROV-XML is an XML language for describing
the provenance of things; applications may evaluate given data to
dereference URIs, invoking the security considerations of the scheme
for that URI. Note in particular, the privacy issues in [RFC3023]
section 10 for HTTP URIs. Data obtained from an inaccurate or
malicious data source may lead to inaccurate or misleading
conclusions, as well as the dereferencing of unintended URIs. Care
must be taken to align the trust in consulted resources with the
sensitivity of the intended use of the data. PROV-XML can express data
which is presented to the user, for example, by means of label
attributes. Application rendering strings retrieved from untrusted
PROV-N documents must ensure that malignant strings may not be used to
mislead the reader. The security considerations in the media type
registration for XML ([RFC3023] section 10) provide additional
guidance around the expression of arbitrary data and markup.

PROV-XML is a language for describing the provenance of things, and
therefore a PROV-XML document is metadata for other resources.
Untrusted PROV-XML documents may mislead its consumers by indicating
that a third-party resource has a reputable lineage, when it has not.
Provenance of PROV-XML document should be sought.

PROV-XML uses QNames mappable to IRIs as term identifiers.
Applications interpreting data expressed in PROV-XML should address
the security issues of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)
[RFC3987] Section 8, as well as Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):
Generic Syntax [RFC3986] Section 7.

Multiple IRIs may have the same appearance. Characters in different
scripts may look similar (a Cyrillic "Ð¾" may appear similar to a Latin
"o"). A character followed by combining characters may have the same
visual representation as another character (LATIN SMALL LETTER E
followed by COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT has the same visual representation
as LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE). Any person or application that is
writing or interpreting data in PROV-N must take care to use the IRI
that matches the intended semantics, and avoid IRIs that make look
similar. Further information about matching of similar characters can
be found in Unicode Security Considerations [UNISEC] and
Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987] Section 8.

Interoperability considerations: There are no known interoperability
issues.

Published specification: PROV-XML: The PROV XML Schema, Hua, Tilmes,
Zednik (eds), Moreau http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-xml/, 2013.

Applications which use this media type: It may be used by any
application for publishing provenance information. This format is
designed to be an XML form of provenance.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Additional Information:

Magic number(s): PROV-XML documents are XML documents and thus may
have initial strings similar to any XML document.
