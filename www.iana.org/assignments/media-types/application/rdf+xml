MIME subtype name: rdf+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: charset

   Same as charset parameter of application/xml, defined in RFC

Encoding considerations:

   Same as charset parameter of application/xml, defined in RFC
   3023 [4].

Security considerations:

   See "Security Considerations" (Section 6).

Interoperability considerations:

   It is RECOMMENDED that RDF documents follow the newer RDF/XML
   Syntax Grammar [1] as opposed to the older RDF Model and Syntax
   specification [7].

   RDF is intended to allow common information to be exchanged
   between disparate applications.  A basis for building common
   understanding is provided by a formal semantics [3], and
   applications that use RDF should do so in ways that are
   consistent with this.

Published specification:

   see RDF/XML Syntax Grammar [1] and RDF: Concepts and Abstract
   Syntax [2] and the older RDF Model and Syntax [7]

Applications which use this media type:

   RDF is device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral and is supported
   by a range of Web user agents and authoring tools.

Additional information:

   Magic number(s): none

      Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently
      identify RDF, RDF documents will have the sequence
      "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" to identify
      the RDF namespace. This will usually be towards the top of
      the document.

File extension(s): .rdf

Macintosh File Type Code(s): "rdf "

Author/Change controller:

   change control over the specification.
