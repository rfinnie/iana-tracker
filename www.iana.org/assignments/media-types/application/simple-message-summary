(RFC 3842 published August 2004, subtype last updated August 2004)

MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: simple-message-summary

Required parameters: none.

Optional parameters: none.

Encoding considerations: This MIME type was designed for
use with protocols which can carry binary-encoded data.
Although the format of this MIME type is similar to RFC 2822,
it is not identical. (Specifically, line folding rules are
SIP-specific and included URIs can contain non-ASCII
characters.) Protocols which do not carry binary data
(which have line length or character-set restrictions
for example) MUST use a reversible transfer encoding
(such as base64) to carry this MIME type.

Security considerations: See the "Security Considerations"
section in this document.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: This document.

Applications which use this media: The simple-message-summary
application subtype supports the exchange of message waiting and
message summary information in SIP networks.
