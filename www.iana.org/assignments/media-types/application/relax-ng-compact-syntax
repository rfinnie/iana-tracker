Required parameters:  none

Optional parameters:  none

Encoding considerations:  UTF-8 or UTF-16 shall be used for this media type.

Security considerations: When the RELAX NG validator retrieves a schema
in the RELAX NG compact syntax, it may further retrieve external schemas
that are referenced from the schema directly or indirectly.  Although
the RELAX NG validator is required not to retrieve an infinite number of
schemas, a large number of external schemas may be retrieved, thus
wasting the network, disk, and CPU power.

Interoperability considerations:  RELAX NG has been widely used as an XML
schema language.  A notable example is the Open Document specification of OASIS.
