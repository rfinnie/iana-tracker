Type name: application

Subtype name: mbms-envelope+xml

Required parameters:
None

Optional parameters:
embedded:  Declares if all objects described in this envelope instance are embedded 
  within the this envelope instance. The value is either 0 (false) or 1 (true) and 
  when this parameter is omitted the value defaults to 0 (false). 
referenced:  Declares if all objects described in this envelope instance are 
  referenced, none is embedded within the envelope. The value is either 0 (false) 
  or 1 (true) and when this parameter is omitted the value defaults to 0 (false).
charset: As specified in RFC 3023 [83] for media type application/xml.

Encoding considerations:
This is an XML document and the encoding considerations are the same as for media 
type "application/xml" defined in RFC 3023 [83].

Security considerations:
This media format contains information about versioning and validity of files, 
telling the receiver if it should invalidate already received files or replace 
previously received files with new version contained or referenced within this 
format. Thus modifying or spoofing an envelope is a simple way of making denial of 
service attack. Thus source authentication and integrity protection of the files are 
recommended. 

Interoperability considerations:
None

Published specification:
3GPP TS 26.346

3GPP MBMS based applications
