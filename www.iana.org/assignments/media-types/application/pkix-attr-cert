(RFC 5877 published May 2010, subtype last updated May 2010)

Type name: application

Subtype name: pkix-attr-cert

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations:
  An attribute certificate provides authorization information.  An
  attribute certificate is most often used in conjunction with a
  public key certificate [RFC5280], and the two certificates
  should use the same encoding of the distinguished name as
  described in the Security Considerations of this document.

Interoperability considerations:
  The media type will be used with HTTP to fetch attribute
  certificates.  Other uses may emerge in the future.

Published specification: RFC 5755

Applications that use this media type:
  The media type is used with a MIME-compliant transport to
  transfer an attribute certificate.  Attribute certificates
  convey authorization information, and they are most often used
  in conjunction with public key certificates as defined in
  [RFC5280].
