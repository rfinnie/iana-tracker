The "application/moss-keys" content type is used on the first body
part of an enclosing multipart/encrypted.  Its content is comprised
of the data encryption key used to encrypt the data in the second
body part and other control information required to decrypt the data,
as defined by Section 2.2.1.  The label "application/moss-keys" must
be used as the value of the protocol parameter of the enclosing
multipart/encrypted; the protocol parameter must be present.

An application/moss-keys body part is constructed as follows:

   Content-Type: application/moss-keys

   <mosskeys>

where the <mosskeys> token is defined as follows.

   <mosskeys>      ::= <version> <dekinfo> 1*<recipasymflds>

   <version>       ::= "Version:" "5" CRLF

   <dekinfo>       ::= "DEK-Info" ":" <dekalgid>
                       [ "," <dekparameters> ] CRLF

   <recipasymflds> ::= <recipid> <asymkeyinfo>

   <recipid>       ::= "Recipient-ID:" <id> CRLF

   <asymkeyinfo>   ::= "Key-Info" ":" <ikalgid> "," <asymencdek> CRLF

The token <id> is defined in Section 4.  The token <version> is
defined in Section 2.1.2.1.  All other tokens are defined in Section
2.2.1.3.
