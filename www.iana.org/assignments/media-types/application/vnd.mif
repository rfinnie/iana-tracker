FrameMaker documents have two major formats: Normal and Maker
Interchange Format (MIF).  The first is a binary format, the second is
text-based.  In addition there are many versions of each of these
formats, corresponding to different versions of the product.  The file
formats and versions can be distinguished by an internal file
signature which allows FrameMaker to automatically handle both forms
and old versions of the files. Both formats are intended to be
portable to different platforms and operating systems.  Adobe Systems,
Inc. owns these formats.

This application is for the FrameMaker Interchange Format (mif)
