Subtype name: mbms-protection-description+xml

Required parameters:
None

Optional parameters:
charset: As specified in RFC 3023 [83] for media type application/xml.

Encoding considerations:
This is an XML document and the encoding considerations are the same as for media 
type "application/xml" defined in RFC 3023 [83].

Security considerations:
The media format is used to configure the security functions of the MBMS delivery. 
Thus a target for any attacker that would like modify a receivers understanding of 
the security functions, either for a denial of service attack or a session 
replacement attack. However the format contains no seceret information that may not 
be shared openly. All security keys are handled using other mechanisms. Source 
authentication and integrity protection is recommended. 

Interoperability considerations:
None
