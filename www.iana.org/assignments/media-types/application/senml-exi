Type name: application

Subtype name: senml-exi

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using
[W3C.REC-exi-20140211].  See RFC 8428 for details.

Security considerations: See Section 13 of RFC 8428.

Interoperability considerations: Applications MUST ignore any XML
tags or attributes that they do not understand unless the attribute
name ends with the "_" character, in which case an error MUST be
generated.  This allows backwards-compatible extensions to this
specification.  The "bver" attribute in the senml XML tag can be used
to ensure the receiver supports a minimal level of functionality
needed by the creator of the XML SenML Pack.  Further information on
using schemas to guide the EXI can be found in RFC 8428.

Published specification: RFC 8428

Applications that use this media type: The type is used by systems
that report, e.g., electrical power usage and environmental
information such as temperature and humidity.  It can be used for a
wide range of sensor reporting systems.

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification for
application/senml-exi is supported by using fragment identifiers as
specified by RFC 8428.
