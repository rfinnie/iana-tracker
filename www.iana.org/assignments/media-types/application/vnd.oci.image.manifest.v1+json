Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json

Required parameters: n/a

Optional parameters: n/a

Encoding considerations: binary

Security Considerations: This JSON format media type inherits the 
   security considerations for JSON. See RFC 8259 section 12. 
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-12)

   Privacy Information: The manifest contains configuration 
      information, with optional annotations. While users may put any
      content they wish into these annotations, there are no 
      requirements for privacy information that must be protected.

   Extensibility: The json payload supports annotations as strings. 
      No executable information or code paths are enabled.

   Compression: The manifest type is not compressed in normal 
      workflows.

   Links: The manifest contains digests of other linked content, 
      which are separately retrieved, with their own security 
      considerations.

Interoperability Considerations: An OCI image manifest may represent 
   one of many different platforms and architectures. When retrieving
   a manifest, the config descriptor 
   https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/config.md
   returns a an object the consumer can determine if this manifest 
   applies to the host platform and architecture.
