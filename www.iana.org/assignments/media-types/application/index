(RFC 2652 published August 1999, subtype last updated August 1999)

MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: index

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: none

Security considerations:

Security considerations come into play in at least the following
two scenarios. Indexing information can leak undesirable amounts
of proprietary information, unless carefully controlled. At a more
fundamental level, the CIP protocol itself requires external
security services to operate in a safe manner. Both topics are
covered below.

Interoperability considerations:

Published specification:

RFC 2652

Applications which use this media type:

This media type is used to contain information about indices and
how they inter-operate to form meshes of index servers.

Additional information:

This media type is not a standalone type. It is the top level of a
tree similar to the vnd or prs trees specified in Section 2.1 of
RFC2048. There are four specified branches to this tree:
application/index.cmd
application/index.response
application/index.obj
application/index.vnd

Each of these branches is a tree in its own right with types
registered below them. See those registrations for more
information on the types allowed below those branches.
