(1)  MIME type name: application

(3)  Required parameters: none

(4)  Optional parameters: none

(5)  Encoding considerations: quoted-printable is always sufficient

(6)  Security considerations: none

The "application/moss-signature" content type is used on the second
body part of an enclosing multipart/signed.  Its content is comprised
of the digital signature of the data in the first body part of the
enclosing multipart/signed and other control information required to
verify that signature, as defined by Section 2.1.2.  The label
"application/moss-signature" must be used as the value of the
protocol parameter of the enclosing multipart/signed; the protocol
parameter must be present.

Part of the signature verification information will be the Message
Integrity Check (MIC) algorithm(s) used during the signature creation
process.  The MIC algorithm(s) identified in this body part must
match the MIC algorithm(s) identified in the micalg parameter of the
enclosing multipart/signed.  If it does (they do) not, a user agent
should identify the discrepancy to a user and it may choose to either
halt or continue processing, giving precedence to the algorithm(s)
identified in this body part.

An application/moss-signature body part is constructed as follows:

   Content-Type: application/moss-signature

   <mosssig>

where the grammar token <mosssig> is defined as follows.

   <mosssig>       ::= <version> ( 1*<origasymflds> )

   <version>       ::= "Version:" "5" CRLF

   <origasymflds>  ::= <origid> <micinfo>

   <origid>        ::= "Originator-ID:" <id> CRLF

   <micinfo>       ::= "MIC-Info:" <micalgid> "," <ikalgid> ","
                       <asymsignmic> CRLF

The token <id> is defined in Section 4.  All other tokens are defined
in Section 2.1.2.3.
