MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - its+xml

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters :
charset
This parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter of the 
"application/xml" media type as specified in IETF RFC 3023.


Encoding considerations :
By virtue of ITS 2.0 elements being XML, the same considerations when
sent as "application/its+xml" as does XML. See RFC 3023, section 3.2.


Security considerations :
Any XML document containing ITS 1.0 "its:rules" elements
http://www.w3.org/TR/its/#selection-global can be labeled with
application/its+xml. An ITS 1.0 or ITS 2.0 document may cause arbitrary
URIs or IRIs to be dereferenced, via the @xlink:href attribute at the
its:rules element. Therefore, the security issues of [RFC3986] Section 7
should be considered. In addition, the contents of resources identified
by file: URIs can in some cases be accessed, processed and returned as
results. An implementation of ITS global rules requires the support of
XPath 1.0 or its successor. Hence, processing of global rules might
encompass dereferencing of URIs or IRIs during computation of XPath
expressions. Arbitrary recursion is possible, as is arbitrarily large
memory usage, and implementations may place limits on CPU and memory
usage, as well as restricting access to system-defined functions. ITS
1.0 and ITS 2.0 permit extensions. Hence it is possible that
application/its+xml may describe content that has security implications
beyond those described here. Because of these considerations
application/its+xml may require integrity protection, either through the
use of signing or transport protection mechanisms.


Interoperability considerations :


Published specification :
http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-its-20070403/ and http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/

Any XML document containing ITS 1.0 "its:rules" elements 
http://www.w3.org/TR/its/#selection-global can be labeled with application/its+xml. 
http://www.w3.org/TR/its/EX-link-external-rules-2.xml provides an example of a 
document linking to a file with ITS 1.0 and ITS 2.0 "rules". The link target is 
at http://www.w3.org/TR/its/EX-link-external-rules-1.xml. There is no need that 
the link target has "its:rules" as a root element. The processing semantics is 
that rules are gathered in document order.


Applications which use this media :
This new media type is being registered to allow for deployment of ITS 1.0 and 
ITS 2.0 on the World Wide Web., e.g. by localization tools.
