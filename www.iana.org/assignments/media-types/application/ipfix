(RFC 5655 published October 2009, subtype last updated October 2009)

Type name: application

Subtype name: ipfix

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: IPFIX Files are binary, and therefore must
be encoded in non-binary contexts.

Security considerations: See the Security Considerations
(Section 12) of RFC 5655, and the Security Considerations of
[RFC5101].

Interoperability considerations: See the "Detailed Specification"
(Section 7) of RFC 5655. The format is designed to be broadly
interoperable, as any valid stream of IPFIX Messages over any
transport specified in [RFC5101] MUST be recognizable as a valid
IPFIX File.

Published specification: RFC 5655, especially Section 7, and
[RFC5101].

Applications that use this media type: Various IPFIX
implementations (see [RFC5153]) support the construction of IPFIX
File Readers and Writers.

Additional information:

Magic number(s): None, although the first two bytes of any IPFIX
File are the first two bytes of a message header, the Version
field, which as of [RFC5101] are always 10 in network byte
order: 0x00, 0x0A.

File extension(s): .ipfix

Macintosh file type code(s): none
