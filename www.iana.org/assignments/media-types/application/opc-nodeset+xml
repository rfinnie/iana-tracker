Media type name: application

Media subtype name: opc-nodeset+xml

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary
   The default and only encoding is UTF8.

Security considerations: The media types are used for the exchange of 
   metadata between industrial applications. Accepting metadata from 
   an untrustworthy source could have many serious consequences. 
   Therefore all consumers of this media type shall not accept files 
   from an untrusted or unverifiable origin.

   The media format itself allows for recursive operations that could 
   be a vector for denial service attacks. All consumers shall have 
   protections to protect against infinite recursive loops.

   The document format does not contain machine code or scripts. It 
   only has metadata that could trigger the execution of existing 
   programs or scripts.

Interoperability considerations: The data format is completely 
   specified in IEC 62541-6. This specification provides a common 
   representation to ensure interoperability across all platforms.
