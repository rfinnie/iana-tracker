Type Name: application

Subtype Name: wasm

Required Parameters: N/A

Optional Parameters: N/A

Encoding Considerations: binary

Security Considerations: WebAssembly is a standard, a safe, portable,
   low-level code format. The security considerations associated with
   executing WebAssembly code are described in 
   https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core/#security-considerations.

   The WebAssembly format includes no integrity or privacy 
   protection. If such protection is needed it must be provided 
   externally, e.g., through the use of HTTPS.

Interoperability Considerations:

   See WebAssembly Core Conformance
   https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core/#conformance

Published specification:

   https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/
   https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-js-api-1/
   https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-web-api-1/

Application Usage: The application/wasm media type is intended for 
   use as the type used to describe WebAssembly files when sent over 
   HTTP to be executed by browsers, which is a common scenario. 
   Additionally, the type is used by several WebAssembly runtimes 
   that take advantage of the safety and portability while targeting 
   efficient execution and compact representation.
