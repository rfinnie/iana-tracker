Type name: application

Subtype name: trickle-ice-sdpfrag

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters: None.

Encoding considerations: The media contents follow the same rules as 
   SDP, except as noted in RFC-ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-18.  The 
   media contents are text, with the grammar specified in Section 9.2.

   Although the initially defined content of a trickle-ice-sdpfrag
   body does only include ASCII characters, UTF-8 encoded content
   might be introduced via extension attributes.  The "charset"
   attribute may be used to signal the presence of other character
   sets in certain parts of a trickle-ice-sdpfrag body (see
   RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-37).  Arbitrary binary content cannot 
   be directly represented in SDP or a trickle-ice-sdpfrag body.

Security considerations: See RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-37 and 
   RFC-ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-18

Interoperability considerations: See 
   RFC-ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-18

Published specification: See RFC-ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-18
