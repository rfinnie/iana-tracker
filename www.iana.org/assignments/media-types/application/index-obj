(RFC 2652 published August 1999, subtype last updated August 1999)

MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: index.obj

Required parameters: type, dsi, base-uri

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: none

Security considerations:

Security considerations come into play in at least the following
two scenarios. Indexing information can leak undesirable amounts
of proprietary information, unless carefully controlled. At a more
fundamental level, the CIP protocol itself requires external
security services to operate in a safe manner. Both topics are
covered below.

Interoperability considerations:

Implementors should handle unknown index objects according to
rules specified in the published specification.

Published specification:

RFC 2652

Applications which use this media type:

This media type is the top of a tree of media types that express
indexes that are exchanged between hosts that operate within a
referral mesh.

Additional information:

This media type is not a standalone type. It is the top of a tree
similar to the vnd and prs trees specified in Section 2.1 of
RFC2048. Types registered within this tree are limited to being
representations of indexes that contain some summary of the data
found in some database and is used to generate referrals as
specified in the above specified publication.
