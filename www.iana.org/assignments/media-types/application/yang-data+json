Type name: application

Subtype name: yang-data+json

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: 8-bit
   Each conceptual YANG data node is encoded according to
   [RFC7951].  A metadata annotation is encoded according to
   [RFC7952].

Security considerations: Security considerations related
   to the generation and consumption of RESTCONF messages
   are discussed in Section 12 of RFC 8040.
   Additional security considerations are specific to the
   semantics of particular YANG data models.  Each YANG module
   is expected to specify security considerations for the
   YANG data defined in that module.

Interoperability considerations: RFC 8040 specifies the format
   of conforming messages and the interpretation thereof.

Published specification: RFC 8040

Applications that use this media type: Instance document
   data parsers used within a protocol or automation tool
   that utilize YANG-defined data structures.

Fragment identifier considerations: The syntax and semantics
   of fragment identifiers are the same as the syntax and semantics
   specified for the "application/json" media type.
