(RFC 6129 published February 2011, subtype last updated February 2011)

MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: tei+xml

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: charset

   the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter
   of the "application/xml" media type as specified in RFC 3023
   [RFC3023].

Encoding considerations:

   Identical to those for 'application/xml'.  See RFC 3023
   [RFC3023], Section 3.2.

Security considerations:

   See Security Considerations (Section 4) in this specification.

Interoperability considerations:

   TEI documents are often given the extension '.xml', which is
   not uncommon for other XML document formats.

Published specification:

   This media type registration is for TEI documents [TEI] as
   described here.  TEI syntax is defined in a schema [TEIschema].

Applications which use this media type:

   There are currently no known applications using the media type
   'application/tei+xml'.

Additional information:

   Magic number(s):

      There is no single initial octet sequence that is always
      present in TEI documents.

   file extension(s):

      Common extensions are '.tei', '.teiCorpus' and '.odd'.  See
      Recognizing TEI files (Section 2) in this specification.
