Type name: application
Subtype name: mbms-register+xml

Required parameters:
None

Optional parameters:
charset: As specified in RFC 3023 [83] for media type application/xml.

Encoding considerations:
This is an XML document and the encoding considerations are the same as for media 
type "application/xml" defined in RFC 3023 [83].

Security considerations:
The content of this format identifies a user service that the document creator 
desires to register to. Any modifications of this document would allow an attacker 
to change to what services the creator registers to. To prevent this integrity 
protection is necessary. There is also necessary to authenticate the entity 
performing the registration to know who is the one performing the registration 
request. In MBMS this is accomplished using procedures described in 3GPP TS 33.246.

Interoperability considerations:
None

Published specification:
3GPP TS 26.346

Applications which use this media type:
3GPP MBMS based applications
