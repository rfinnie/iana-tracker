Type name:  application

Subtype name:  jscalendar+json

Required parameters:  type

   The "type" parameter conveys the type of the JSCalendar data in
   the body part, with the value being one of "jsevent", "jstask", or
   "jsgroup".  The parameter MUST NOT occur more than once.  It MUST
   match the value of the "@type" property of the JSON-formatted
   JSCalendar object in the body.

Optional parameters:  none

Encoding considerations:  Same as encoding considerations of
   application/json as specified in RFC8529, Section 11.

Security considerations:  See Section 7 of RFC-ietf-calext-jscalendar-32.

Interoperability considerations:  While JSCalendar is designed to
   avoid ambiguities as much as possible, when converting objects
   from other calendar formats to/from JSCalendar it is possible that
   differing representations for the same logical data might arise,
   or ambiguities in interpretation.  The semantic equivalence of two
   JSCalendar objects may be determined differently by different
   applications, for example where URL values differ in case between
   the two objects.

Published specification:  RFC-ietf-calext-jscalendar-32

Applications that use this media type:  Applications that currently
   make use of the text/calendar and application/calendar+json media
   types can use this as an alternative.  Similarly, applications
   that use the application/json media type to transfer calendaring
   data can use this to further specify the content.

Fragment identifier considerations:  A JSON Pointer fragment
   identifier may be used, as defined in [RFC6901], Section 6.
