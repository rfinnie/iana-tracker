(registered by RFC7390, last updated 2014-10-24)

Type name: application

Subtype name: coap-group+json

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: 8-bit UTF-8.

JSON to be represented using UTF-8, which is 8-bit compatible (and
most efficient for resource constrained implementations).

Security considerations:

Denial-of-Service attacks could be performed by constantly
(re-)setting the group configuration resource of a CoAP endpoint to
different values. This will cause the endpoint to register (or
deregister) from the related IP multicast group. To prevent this, it is
recommended that a form of authorization (making use of unicast DTLS-
secured CoAP) be used such that only authorized controllers are
allowed by an endpoint to configure its group membership.

Interoperability considerations: None

Published specification: RFC7390

Applications that use this media type:
