(RFC 6726 published November 2012, subtype last updated November 2012)

Type name: application

Subtype name: fdt+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: charset="utf-8"

Encoding considerations: binary (the FLUTE file delivery protocol
does not impose any restriction on the objects it carries and in
particular on the FDT Instance itself)

Restrictions on usage: none

Security considerations: fdt+xml data is passive and does not
generally represent a unique or new security threat. However, there
is some risk in sharing any kind of data, in that unintentional
information may be exposed, and that risk applies to fdt+xml data as
well.

Interoperability considerations: None

Published specification: [RFC6726], especially noting Section 3.4.2.
The specified FDT Instance functions as an actual media format of use
to the general Internet community, and thus media type registration
under the Standards Tree is appropriate to maximize interoperability.

Applications that use this media type: file and object delivery
applications and protocols (e.g., FLUTE).

Additional information:

Magic number(s): none
File extension(s): ".fdt" (e.g., if there is a need to store an
FDT Instance as a file)
Macintosh File Type Code(s): none
