Type name: application

Subtype name: sensml+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using
[W3C.REC-xml-20081126].  See RFC 8428 for details.

Security considerations: See Section 13 of RFC 8428.

Interoperability considerations: Applications MUST ignore any XML
tags or attributes that they do not understand unless the attribute
name ends with the "_" character, in which case an error MUST be
generated.  This allows backwards-compatible extensions to this
specification.  The "bver" attribute in the senml XML tag can be used
to ensure the receiver supports a minimal level of functionality
needed by the creator of the XML SenML Pack.

Published specification: RFC 8428
