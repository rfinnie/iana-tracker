(RFC 5537 published November 2009, subtype last updated November 2009)

MIME type name:           application

MIME subtype name:        news-transmission

Required parameters:      none

Optional parameters:      One and only one of "usage=moderate",
                          "usage=inject", or "usage=relay".

Encoding considerations:  A transfer-encoding different from that
                          of the article transmitted MAY be
                          supplied to ensure correct transmission
                          over some 7bit transport medium.

Security considerations:  News articles may constitute "control
                          messages", which can have effects on a
                          host's news system beyond just addition
                          of information.  Since control messages
                          may occur in normal news flow, most hosts
                          are suitably defended against undesired
                          effects already, but transmission of news
                          articles via mail may bypass
                          firewall-type defenses.

Published specification:  RFC 5537

Body part:                A complete proto-article ready for
                          injection into Netnews or an article
                          being relayed to another agent.

Applications that use this media type:
                          Injecting agents, Netnews moderators.

Intended usage:           COMMON

Change controller:        IETF

usage=moderate indicates the article is intended for a moderator,
usage=inject for an injecting agent, and usage=relay for a relaying
agent.  The entity receiving the article may only implement one type
of agent, in which case the parameter MAY be omitted.

Contrary to the prior registration of this media type, article
batches are not permitted as a body part.  Multiple messages or a
message with multiple application/news-transmission parts may be used
instead.
