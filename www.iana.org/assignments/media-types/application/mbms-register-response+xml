Type name: application

Subtype name: mbms-register-response+xml

Required parameters:
None

Optional parameters:
charset: As specified in RFC 3023 [83] for media type application/xml.

Encoding considerations:
This is an XML document and the encoding considerations are the same as for media 
type "application/xml" defined in RFC 3023 [83].

Security considerations:
The usage of the format is to identify one or more response codes of registration or 
deregistration procedures. Modification or changes to this format thus only result in a 
denial of service attack. Integrity protection would protect against such modifications. 
In MBMS this is accomplished using procedures described in 3GPP TS 33.246

Interoperability considerations:
None

Published specification:
3GPP TS 26.346

3GPP MBMS based applications
