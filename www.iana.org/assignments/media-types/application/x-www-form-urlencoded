MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - x-www-form-urlencoded

Required parameters : No parameters

Optional parameters : 
No parameters

Encoding considerations : 7bit


Security considerations : 
In isolation, an application/x-www-form-urlencoded payload poses no 
security risks. However, as this type is usually used as part of a form 
submission, all the risks that apply to HTML forms need to be considered 
in the context of this type.

These risks fall into multiple categories that pertain to the 
same-origin policy and cross-origin reach of HTML forms 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#security), general HTML application threats 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html/single-page.html#writing-secure-applications-with-html), 
and not relying on client-side validation for anything other than user 
feedback (http://www.w3.org/TR/html/single-page.html#security-forms).

Interoperability considerations : 
Rules for generating and processing application/x-www-form-urlencoded payloads are defined in the HTML specification.

Published specification : 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html is the relevant specification. Algorithms for encoding and decoding are defined.

Applications which use this media : 
Web browsers and servers.

Fragment identifier considerations :
Fragment identifiers have no meaning with the application/x-www-form-urlencoded type.

Restrictions on usage :
This type is only intended to be used to describe HTML form submission payloads.

Provisional registration? (standards tree only) :
No.


Additional information :

1. Deprecated alias names for this type : N/A
2. Magic number(s) : There is no reliable mechanism for recognising such payloads
3. File extension(s) : Not applicable
4. Macintosh file type code : Not applicable
5. Object Identifiers: N/A
