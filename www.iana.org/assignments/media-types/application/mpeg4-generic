(RFC 3640 published November 2003, subtype last updated November 2003)

MIME media type name: "video" or "audio" or "application"

"video" MUST be used for MPEG-4 Visual streams (ISO/IEC 14496-2) or
MPEG-4 Systems streams (ISO/IEC 14496-1) that convey information
needed for an audio/visual presentation.

"audio" MUST be used for MPEG-4 Audio streams (ISO/IEC 14496-3) or
MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey information needed for an audio
only presentation.

"application" MUST be used for MPEG-4 Systems streams (ISO/IEC
14496-1) that serve purposes other than audio/visual presentation,
e.g., in some cases when MPEG-J (Java) streams are transmitted.

Depending on the required payload configuration, MIME format
parameters may need to be available to the receiver.  This is done
using the parameters described in the next section.  There are
required and optional parameters.

Optional parameters are of two types: general parameters and
configuration parameters.  The configuration parameters are used to
configure the fields in the AU Header section and in the auxiliary
section.  The absence of any configuration parameter is equivalent to
the associated field set to its default value, which is always zero.
The absence of all configuration parameters results in a default
"basic" configuration with an empty AU-header section and an empty
auxiliary section in each RTP packet.

MIME subtype name: mpeg4-generic

Required parameters:

MIME format parameters are not case dependent; for clarity however,
both upper and lower case are used in the names of the parameters
described in this specification.

   streamType:
   The integer value that indicates the type of MPEG-4 stream that is
   carried; its coding corresponds to the values of the streamType,
   as defined in Table 9 (streamType Values) in ISO/IEC 14496-1.

   profile-level-id:
   A decimal representation of the MPEG-4 Profile Level indication.
   This parameter MUST be used in the capability exchange or session
   set-up procedure to indicate the MPEG-4 Profile and Level
   combination of which the relevant MPEG-4 media codec is capable.

   For MPEG-4 Audio streams, this parameter is the decimal value from
      Table 5 (audioProfileLevelIndication Values) in ISO/IEC 14496-
      1, indicating which MPEG-4 Audio tool subsets are required to
      decode the audio stream.

   For MPEG-4 Visual streams, this parameter is the decimal value
      from Table G-1 (FLC table for profile and level indication) of
      ISO/IEC 14496-2 [1], indicating which MPEG-4 Visual tool
      subsets are required to decode the visual stream.

   For BIFS streams, this parameter is the decimal value obtained
      from (SPLI + 256*GPLI), where:
      SPLI is the decimal value from Table 4 in ISO/IEC 14496-1 with
               the applied sceneProfileLevelIndication;
      GPLI is the decimal value from Table 7 in ISO/IEC 14496-1 with
         the applied graphicsProfileLevelIndication.

   For MPEG-J streams, this parameter is the decimal value from table
      13 (MPEGJProfileLevelIndication) in ISO/IEC 14496-1, indicating
      the profile and level of the MPEG-J stream.

   For OD streams, this parameter is the decimal value from table 3
      (ODProfileLevelIndication) in ISO/IEC 14496-1, indicating the
      profile and level of the OD stream.

   For IPMP streams, this parameter has either the decimal value 0,
      indicating an unspecified profile and level, or a value larger
      than zero, indicating an MPEG-4 IPMP profile and level as
      defined in a future MPEG-4 specification.

   For Clock Reference streams and Object Content Info streams, this
      parameter has the decimal value zero, indicating that profile
      and level information is conveyed through the OD framework.

   config:
   A hexadecimal representation of an octet string that expresses the
   media payload configuration.  Configuration data is mapped onto
   the hexadecimal octet string in an MSB-first basis.  The first bit
   of the configuration data SHALL be located at the MSB of the first
   octet.  In the last octet, if necessary to achieve octet-
   alignment, up to 7 zero-valued padding bits shall follow the
   configuration data.

   For MPEG-4 Audio streams, config is the audio object type specific
      decoder configuration data AudioSpecificConfig(), as defined in
      ISO/IEC 14496-3.  For Structured Audio, the
      AudioSpecificConfig() may be conveyed by other means, not
      defined by this specification.  If the AudioSpecificConfig() is
      conveyed by other means for Structured Audio, then the config
      MUST be a quoted empty hexadecimal octet string, as follows:
      config="".

      Note that a future mode of using this RTP payload format for
      Structured Audio may define such other means.

   For MPEG-4 Visual streams, config is the MPEG-4 Visual
      configuration information as defined in subclause 6.2.1, Start
      codes of ISO/IEC 14496-2.  The configuration information
      indicated by this parameter SHALL be the same as the
      configuration information in the corresponding MPEG-4 Visual
      stream, except for first-half-vbv-occupancy and latter-half-
      vbv-occupancy, if it exists, which may vary in the repeated
      configuration information inside an MPEG-4 Visual stream (See
      6.2.1 Start codes of ISO/IEC 14496-2).

   For BIFS streams, this is the BIFSConfig() information as defined
      in ISO/IEC 14496-1.  Version 1 of BIFSConfig is defined in
      section 9.3.5.2, and version 2 is defined in section 9.3.5.3.
      The MIME format parameter objectType signals the version of
      BIFSConfig.

   For IPMP streams, this is either a quoted empty hexadecimal octet
      string, indicating the absence of any decoder configuration
      information (config=""), or the IPMPConfiguration() as will be
      defined in a future MPEG-4 IPMP specification.

   For Object Content Info (OCI) streams, this is the
      OCIDecoderConfiguration() information of the OCI stream, as
      defined in section 8.4.2.4 in ISO/IEC 14496-1.

   For OD streams, Clock Reference streams and MPEG-J streams, this
      is a quoted empty hexadecimal octet string (config=""), as no
      information on the decoder configuration is required.

   mode:
   The mode in which this specification is used.  The following modes
   can be signaled:

   mode=generic,
   mode=CELP-cbr,
   mode=CELP-vbr,
   mode=AAC-lbr and
   mode=AAC-hbr.

   Other modes are expected to be defined in future RFCs.  See also
   section 3.3.7 and 4.2 of RFC 3640.

Optional general parameters:

   objectType:
   The decimal value from Table 8 in ISO/IEC 14496-1, indicating the
   value of the objectTypeIndication of the transported stream.  For
   BIFS streams, this parameter MUST be present to signal the version
   of BIFSConfiguration().  Note that objectTypeIndication may signal
   a non-MPEG-4 stream and that the RTP payload format defined in
   this document may not be suitable for carrying a stream that is
   not defined by MPEG-4.  The objectType parameter SHOULD NOT be set
   to a value that signals a stream that cannot be carried by this
   payload format.

   constantSize:
   The constant size in octets of each Access Unit for this stream.
   The constantSize and the sizeLength parameters MUST NOT be
   simultaneously present.

   constantDuration:
   The constant duration of each Access Unit for this stream,
   measured with the same units as the RTP time stamp.

   maxDisplacement:
   The decimal representation of the maximum displacement in time of
   an interleaved AU, as defined in section 3.2.3.3, expressed in
   units of the RTP time stamp clock.

   This parameter MUST be present when interleaving is applied.

   de-interleaveBufferSize:
   The decimal representation in number of octets of the size of the
   de-interleave buffer, described in section 3.2.3.3.  When
   interleaving, this parameter MUST be present if the calculation of
   the de-interleave buffer size given in 3.2.3.3 and based on
   maxDisplacement and rate(max) under-estimates the size of the
   de-interleave buffer.  If this calculation does not under-estimate
   the size of the de-interleave buffer, then the
   de-interleaveBufferSize parameter SHOULD NOT be present.

Optional configuration parameters:

   sizeLength:
   The number of bits on which the AU-size field is encoded in the
   AU-header.  The sizeLength and the constantSize parameters MUST
   NOT be simultaneously present.

   indexLength:
   The number of bits on which the AU-Index is encoded in the first
   AU-header.  The default value of zero indicates the absence of the
   AU-Index field in each first AU-header.

   indexDeltaLength:
   The number of bits on which the AU-Index-delta field is encoded in
   any non-first AU-header.  The default value of zero indicates the
   absence of the AU-Index-delta field in each non-first AU-header.

   CTSDeltaLength:
   The number of bits on which the CTS-delta field is encoded in the
   AU-header.

   DTSDeltaLength:
   The number of bits on which the DTS-delta field is encoded in the
   AU-header.

   randomAccessIndication:
   A decimal value of zero or one, indicating whether the RAP-flag is
   present in the AU-header.  The decimal value of one indicates
   presence of the RAP-flag, the default value zero indicates its
   absence.

   streamStateIndication:
   The number of bits on which the Stream-state field is encoded in
   the AU-header.  This parameter MAY be present when transporting
   MPEG-4 system streams, and SHALL NOT be present for MPEG-4 audio
   and MPEG-4 video streams.

   auxiliaryDataSizeLength:
   The number of bits that is used to encode the auxiliary-data-size
   field.

Applications MAY use more parameters, in addition to those defined
above.  Each additional parameter MUST be registered with IANA to
ensure that there is not a clash of names.  Each additional parameter
MUST be accompanied by a specification in the form of an RFC, MPEG
standard, or other permanent and readily available reference (the
"Specification Required" policy defined in RFC 2434 [6]).  Receivers
MUST tolerate the presence of such additional parameters, but these
parameters SHALL NOT impact the decoding of receivers that comply
with this specification.

Encoding considerations:
This MIME subtype is defined for RTP transport only.  System
bitstreams MUST be generated according to MPEG-4 Systems
specifications (ISO/IEC 14496-1).  Video bitstreams MUST be generated
according to MPEG-4 Visual specifications (ISO/IEC 14496-2).  Audio
bitstreams MUST be generated according to MPEG-4 Audio specifications
(ISO/IEC 14496-3).  The RTP packets MUST be packetized according to
the RTP payload format defined in RFC 3640.

Security considerations:
As defined in section 5 of RFC 3640.

Interoperability considerations:
MPEG-4 provides a large and rich set of tools for the coding of
visual objects.  For effective implementation of the standard,
subsets of the MPEG-4 tool sets have been provided for use in
specific applications.  These subsets, called 'Profiles', limit the
size of the tool set a decoder is required to implement.  In order to
restrict computational complexity, one or more 'Levels' are set for
each Profile.  A Profile@Level combination allows:

    .  a codec builder to implement only the subset of the standard
       he needs, while maintaining interworking with other MPEG-4
       devices that implement the same combination, and

    .  checking whether MPEG-4 devices comply with the standard
       ('conformance testing').

A stream SHALL be compliant with the MPEG-4 Profile@Level specified
by the parameter "profile-level-id".  Interoperability between a
sender and a receiver is achieved by specifying the parameter
"profile-level-id" in MIME content.  In the capability
exchange/announcement procedure, this parameter may mutually be set
to the same value.

Published specification:
The specifications for MPEG-4 streams are presented in ISO/IEC
14496-1, 14496-2, and 14496-3.  The RTP payload format is described
in RFC 3640.

Applications which use this media type:
Multimedia streaming and conferencing tools.
