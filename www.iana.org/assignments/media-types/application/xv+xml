(RFC 4374 published January 2006)

MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: xv+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:

charset: has the same semantics as the charset parameter of the
"application/xml" media type specified in [1].

Encoding considerations:
XHTML+Voice has the same media type encoding considerations
specified in Section 3.2 of [1].

Security considerations:
XHTML+Voice is an extension of XHTML and has the same security
issues as XHTML.  These include interpreting anchors and forms in
XHTML documents, and scripting languages and other dynamic
interactive capabilities.  See Section 7 of [2].
In addition, the scripting language can be accessed by both the
XHTML and the VoiceXML 2.0 markup embedded in the XHTML+Voice
document.  See Section 1.3.1.5 of [8].
XML-Events [7] allows an author to attach a handler to any node in
the document.  The handler that is activated in response to a
specified event may be either a voice dialog or a script that can
be in either the same or an external document.

Interoperability considerations:
Because XHTML+Voice is built upon W3C standard recommendations, it
is designed to be interoperable across a wide range of platforms
and client devices.  Because the extensions to XHTML are
identified by their namespaces, all browsers that have namespace
support can run an XHTML+Voice document as an XHTML document
without voice interaction.

Published specification:
The latest published version of XHTML+Voice is [8].

Applications which use this media type:
XHTML+Voice documents are intended to be deployed on the World
Wide Web and rendered by multimodal browsers that support the
visual and voice modes of interaction.  Because XHTML+Voice is an
application of XML, authors can expect XHTML+Voice user agents to
be conformant XML 1.0 [3] processors.  See section 2 of [2].
