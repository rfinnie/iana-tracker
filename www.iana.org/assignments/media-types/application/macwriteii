ENCODING CONSIDERATIONS:

MacWrite files are encoded in the data fork of a macintosh file.  The
type creator is MW2D, the file type is MWII.  This data is in binary
format. Some encoding will be necessary for MIME mailers.

MacWrite files that contain external data references such as publish &
subscribe services are explicitly not allowed.  All such data
references should be collected before tranmission.


SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
None known.

PUBLISHED SPECIFICATION:
None known.  

Specification by example:  Using Claris Corp.'s MacWrite II select a
document.  Choose the File Menu and select the "Save As..." option.
Input a filename and make sure the FileType is specified as 
"MacWriteII".  Click on the OK button.  You have now created a
filetype that corresponds to the MIME Content-Type
application/MacWriteII

Note that other products can parse this format, including MicroSoft
Word, and MacLink+ Translators.
