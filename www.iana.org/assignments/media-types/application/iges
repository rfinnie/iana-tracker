IGES is a commonly used format for CAD model (3-D or 2-D) interchange.
An IGES file is also used for simple illustrations/figures between CAD
or "drawing" applications. The latter may also be suitable for WWW
vector image graphics. IGES files include parameters about the IGES
object itself, e.g., version number, model size, encoded elements. The
IGES Project committee has approved (3/94) the submission for
registration of the format as a MIME data type.

--------- issue noted during comment period -------------

Proposed registration (as it appears above) sent to
ietf-types&cs.utk.edu on 3/15/95 per RFC 1590 resulted in discussions
about the possible need for a new 3D Media Type. (This discussion was
raised when registration for VRML was proposed.) The IGES Project
people opined that at such time as the the requirements are resolved
and new Types registered (e.g., Type CAD or Type 3D), that IGES, and
perhaps other formats, may need to be considered for repositioning as
subtypes of such new Media Type. However, using the above Type/Subtype
and IGES viewers has demonstrated the expected functionality.
