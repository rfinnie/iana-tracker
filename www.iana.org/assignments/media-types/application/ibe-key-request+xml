(RFC 5408 published January 2009, subtype last updated January 2009)

MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: ibe-key-request+xml

Mandatory parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: This media type MUST be encoded as US-ASCII
[ASCII].

Security considerations: The data conveyed in this media type may
contain authentication credentials. Because of this, its
confidentiality and integrity is extremely important. To ensure
this, the request for an IBE private key must take place over a
secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or its successors. To ensure the
validity of the server, the client MUST verify the server
certificate and MUST abort the key request if the verification of
the server certificate of the TLS connection fails. This media
type contains no active content and does not use compression.

Interoperability considerations: There are no known interoperability
considerations for this media type.

Applications that use this media type: Applications that implement
IBE in compliance with this specification will use this media
type. The most commonly used of these applications are encrypted
email and file encryption.
