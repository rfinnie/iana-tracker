Type name: application

Subtype name: ipp

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: IPP requests/responses MAY contain long
lines and ALWAYS contain binary data (for example, attribute value
lengths).

Security considerations: IPP requests/responses do not introduce any
security risks not already inherent in the underlying transport
protocols. Protocol mixed-version interworking rules in [RFC8011] as
well as protocol-encoding rules in this document are complete and
unambiguous. See also the security considerations in this document
and [RFC8011].

Interoperability considerations: IPP requests (generated by Clients)
and responses (generated by servers) MUST comply with all conformance
requirements imposed by the normative specifications [RFC8011] and
this document. Protocol-encoding rules specified in RFC 8010 are
comprehensive so that interoperability between conforming
implementations is guaranteed (although support for specific optional
features is not ensured). Both the "charset" and "natural-language"
of all IPP attribute values that are a LOCALIZED-STRING are explicit
within IPP requests/responses (without recourse to any external
information in HTTP, SMTP, or other message transport headers).

Published specifications: RFCs 8010 and 8011

Applications that use this media type: Internet Printing Protocol
(IPP) print clients and print servers that communicate using HTTP/
HTTPS or other transport protocols. Messages of type "application/
ipp" are self-contained and transport independent, including
"charset" and "natural-language" context for any LOCALIZED-STRING
value.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A
