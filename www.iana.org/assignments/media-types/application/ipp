(RFC 2910 published September 2000, subtype last updated September 2000)

MIME type name: application

MIME subtype name: ipp

A Content-Type of "application/ipp" indicates an Internet Printing
Protocol message body (request or response). Currently there is one
version: IPP/1.1, whose syntax is described in Section 3 "Encoding of
the Operation Layer" of [RFC2910], and whose semantics are described
in [RFC2911].

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations:

IPP/1.1 protocol requests/responses MAY contain long lines and ALWAYS
contain binary data (for example attribute value lengths).

Security considerations:

IPP/1.1 protocol requests/responses do not introduce any security
risks not already inherent in the underlying transport protocols.
Protocol mixed-version interworking rules in [RFC2911] as well as
protocol encoding rules in [RFC2910] are complete and unambiguous.

Interoperability considerations:

IPP/1.1 requests (generated by clients) and responses (generated by
servers) MUST comply with all conformance requirements imposed by the
normative specifications [RFC2911] and [RFC2910]. Protocol encoding
rules specified in [RFC2910] are comprehensive, so that
interoperability between conforming implementations is guaranteed
(although support for specific optional features is not ensured).
Both the "charset" and "natural-language" of all IPP/1.1 attribute
values which are a LOCALIZED-STRING are explicit within IPP protocol
requests/responses (without recourse to any external information in
HTTP, SMTP, or other message transport headers).

Published specifications:

[RFC2911] Hastings, T., Herriot, R., deBry, R., Isaacson, S. and P.
Powell, "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and
Semantics", RFC 2911, September 2000.

[RFC2910] Herriot, R., Butler, S., Moore, P., Turner, R. and J.
Wenn, "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and
Transport", RFC 2910, September 2000.

Applications which use this media type:

Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) print clients and print servers,
communicating using HTTP/1.1 (see [RFC2910]), SMTP/ESMTP, FTP, or
other transport protocol. Messages of type "application/ipp" are
self-contained and transport-independent, including "charset" and
"natural-language" context for any LOCALIZED-STRING value.
