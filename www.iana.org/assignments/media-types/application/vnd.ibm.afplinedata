Encoding considerations :

 IBM's Line Data carries text and can also carry some of the data
 defined in IBM's Mixed Object Document Content Architecture
 (MO:DCA).  The MO:DCA data can be text, image, and graphics data objects.
 Therefore, IBM's Line Data can be a mixture of binary and character
 data.  The recommended content-transfer-encoding is base64.

Security considerations :

IBM's Line Data is not a programming language, does not contain file
operators, and therefore cannot corrupt a receiver's file system or
programming environment.

Interoperability considerations : None

Reference (IBM publication S544-3884).
