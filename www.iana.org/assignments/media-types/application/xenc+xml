Magic number(s): none

Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently identify XML Encryption documents, they will be XML documents in which the root element's QName's LocalPart is 'EncryptedData' or 'EncryptedKey' with an associated namespace name of 'http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#'. The application/xenc+xml type name MUST only be used for data objects in which the root element is from the XML Encryption namespace. XML documents which contain these element types in places other than the root element can be described using facilities such as [XML-schema].
