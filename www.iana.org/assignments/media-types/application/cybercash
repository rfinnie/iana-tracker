MEDIA TYPE NAME:
Application

MEDIA SUBTYPE NAME:
CyberCash

REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
none
(CyberCash messages encode within themselves a format version number) 

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
none

ENCODING CONSIDERATIONS:

CyberCash messages are currently in 7 bit US-ASCII with limited line
lengths. Some message types are quite readable but many include within
them some digital signature information and many have large portions
encrypted. This signature and/or encrypted information is essentially
binary and is currently base64 encoded in certain fields. In the
future, CyberCash messages may be extended to include a more extended
set of byte values in which case a Content-Transfer-Encoding of other
than 7bit will be required.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

The CyberCash system is designed so that a secure channel is not
required other than for privacy reasons. Someone observing CyberCash
messages may be able to tell who is transfering funds to whom and for
what reason but they will not be able to misappropriate funds based on
these messages unless they can break the cryptosystems used. Use of
CyberCash messages within a secure envelope will usually eliminate all
privacy concerns other than basic traffic analysis. No currently
defined CyberCash messages has any "executable" material.
