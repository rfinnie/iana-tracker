Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary (framed transport)

   Being an object inside of the AFP MO:DCA specification, a 
   character set carries binary data. The recommended 
   content-transfer-encoding is "base64".

Security considerations: Character Sets are part of MO:DCA, which is 
   an architected specification of final-form presentation data. It 
   is not a programming language, does not contain any file 
   operators, and therefore cannot corrupt a receiver's file system 
   or programming environment. It does not allow executable content 
   or calls to external applications.

   The format does not provide integrity or privacy protection in 
   itself. Integrity on file level could be ensured by means external
   to the specification.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: As part of "FOCA Reference (Font Object 
   Content Architecture Reference)", AFP Consortium publication 
   AFPC-0007-06.

Application usage: A character set is a MO:DCA resource object 
   describing sets of graphic characters with similar design 
   characteristics.

   Used in Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) generators and 
   consumers. A wide variety of applications are created by members 
   of the AFP Consortium and other parties.

Fragment Identifier Considerations: N/A

Restrictions in Usage: This format is mostly used in applications 
   around high speed transactional printing.
