Type name: application

Subtype name: coap-payload

Required parameters: "cf" (CoAP Content-Format integer in range
0-65535 denoting the content-format of the CoAP payload carried, as
defined by the "CoAP Content-Formats" subregistry that is part of the
"Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry).

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: Common use is BINARY.  The specific CoAP
content-format encoding considerations for the selected Content-
Format ("cf" parameter) apply.  The encoding can vary based on the
value of the "cf" parameter.

Security considerations: The specific CoAP content-format security
considerations for the selected Content-Format ("cf" parameter)
apply.

Interoperability considerations: This media type can never be used
directly in CoAP messages because there are no means available to
encode the mandatory "cf" parameter in CoAP.

Published specification: RFC 8075

Applications that use this media type: HTTP-to-CoAP proxies.

Fragment identifier considerations: CoAP does not support URI
fragments; therefore, a CoAP payload fragment cannot be identified.
Fragments are not applicable for this media type.

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage:

An application (or user) can only use this media type if it has to
represent a CoAP payload of which the specified CoAP Content-Format
is an unrecognized number, such that a proper translation directly to
the equivalent HTTP media type is not possible.
