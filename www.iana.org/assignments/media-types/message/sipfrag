(per RFC3420)

Media type name: message
Media subtype name: sipfrag
Required parameters: none
Optional parameters: version
  Version: The SIP-Version number of the enclosed message (e.g.,
  "2.0"). If not present, the version defaults to "2.0".
Encoding scheme: SIP messages consist of an 8-bit header optionally
  followed by a binary MIME data object. As such, SIP messages must
  be treated as binary. Under normal circumstances SIP messages are
  transported over binary-capable transports, no special encodings
  are needed.
