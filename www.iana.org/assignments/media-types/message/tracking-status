(per RFC3886)

MIME type name:           message
MIME subtype name:        tracking-status
Optional parameters:      none
Encoding considerations:  "7bit" encoding is sufficient and
                          MUST be used to maintain readability
                          when viewed by non-MIME mail readers.
Security considerations:  discussed in section 4 of this memo.
