(registered 1993, obsoleted by RFC5537)

MIME type name:           message

MIME subtype name:        news

Required parameters:      none

Optional parameters:      none

Encoding considerations:  same as message/rfc822

Security considerations:  News articles may constitute "control
                          messages", which can have effects on a
                          host's news system beyond just addition
                          of information.  Since control messages
                          may occur in normal news flow, most hosts
                          are suitably defended against undesired
                          effects already, but transmission of news
                          articles via mail may bypass
                          firewall-type defenses.  Reading a news
                          article transmitted by mail involves no
                          hazards beyond those of mail, but
                          submitting it to news software for
                          processing should be done with care.

Interoperability considerations:
                          Rarely used, and therefore often
                          handled as application/octet-stream.
                          Disposition should by default be inline.

Published specification:  RFC 5537
