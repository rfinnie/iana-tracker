(per RFC1894)

MIME type name:                message
MIME subtype name:             delivery-status
Optional parameters:           none
Encoding considerations:       "7bit" encoding is sufficient and
                               MUST be used to maintain readability
                               when viewed by non-MIME mail
                               readers.
Security considerations:       discussed in section 4 of this memo.
