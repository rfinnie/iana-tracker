(RFC3798 contains updated template; template previously included in RFC2298)

MIME type name:      message

MIME subtype name:   disposition-notification

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations:  "7bit" encoding is sufficient and
                          MUST be used to maintain readability
                          when viewed by non-MIME mail readers.

Security considerations:  discussed in section 6 of this memo.
