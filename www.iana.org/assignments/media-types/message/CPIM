(per RFC3862)

MIME media type name: message

MIME subtype name: CPIM

Required parameters: (None)

Optional parameters: (None)

Encoding considerations:
   Intended to be used in 8-bit clean environments, with non-
   transformative encoding (8-bit or binary, according to the content
   contained within the message;  the CPIM message headers can be
   handled in an 8-bit text environment).

   This content type could be used with a 7-bit transfer environment
   if appropriate transfer encoding is used.  NOTE that for this
   purpose, enclosed MIME content MUST BE treated as opaque data and
   encoded accordingly.  Any encoding must be reversed before any
   enclosed MIME content can be accessed.

Security considerations:
   The content may contain signed data, so any transfer encoding MUST
   BE exactly reversed before the content is processed.

   See also the security considerations for email messages (RFC 2822
   [9]).

Interoperability considerations:
   This content format is intended to be used to exchange possibly-
   secured messages between different instant messaging protocols.
   Very strict adherence to the message format (including whitespace
   usage) may be needed to achieve interoperability.

Published specification: RFC 3862
