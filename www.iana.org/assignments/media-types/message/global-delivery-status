(template updated by RFC6533; previous version included in RFC5337)

Type name:  message

Subtype name:  global-delivery-status

Required parameters:  none

Optional parameters:  none

Encoding considerations:  This media type contains delivery status
   notification attributes in the UTF-8 charset.  The 8-bit content
   transfer encoding MUST be used with this content-type, unless it
   is sent over a 7-bit transport environment, in which case quoted-
   printable or base64 may be necessary.

Security considerations:  See Section 7

Interoperability considerations:  This media type provides
   functionality similar to the message/delivery-status content-type
   for email message return information.  Clients of the previous
   format will need to be upgraded to interpret the new format;
   however, the new media type makes it simple to identify the
   difference.

Published specification:  RFC 6533

Applications that use this media type:  SMTP servers and email
   clients that support delivery status notification generation or
   parsing.

Additional information:

   Magic number(s):  none

   File extension(s):  The extension ".u8dsn" is suggested.

   Macintosh file type code(s):  A uniform type identifier (UTI) of
      "public.utf8-email-message-delivery-status" is suggested.  This
      type conforms to "public.utf8-plain-text".
