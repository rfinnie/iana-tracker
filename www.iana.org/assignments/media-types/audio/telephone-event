(registered by RFC2833, updated by RFC4733)

Type name: audio

Subtype name: telephone-event

Required parameters: none.

Optional parameters:

   The "events" parameter lists the events supported by the
   implementation.  Events are listed as one or more comma-separated
   elements.  Each element can be either a single integer providing
   the value of an event code or an integer followed by a hyphen and
   a larger integer, presenting a range of consecutive event code
   values.  The list does not have to be sorted.  No white space is
   allowed in the argument.  The union of all of the individual event
   codes and event code ranges designates the complete set of event
   numbers supported by the implementation.  If the "events"
   parameter is omitted, support for events 0-15 (the DTMF tones) is
   assumed.

   The "rate" parameter describes the sampling rate, in Hertz.  The
   number is written as an integer.  If omitted, the default value is
   8000 Hz.

Encoding considerations:

   In the terminology defined by [8] section 4.8, this type is framed
   and binary.

Security considerations:

   See Section 6, "Security Considerations", in this document.

Interoperability considerations: none.

Published specification: this document.

Applications which use this media:

   The telephone-event audio subtype supports the transport of events
   occurring in telephone systems over the Internet.
