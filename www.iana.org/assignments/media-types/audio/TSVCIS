Type name: audio

Subtype name: TSVCIS

Required parameters: Clock Rate (Hz): 8000

Optional parameters:

  ptime: the recommended length of time (in milliseconds)
     represented by the media in a packet.  It SHALL use the nearest
     rounded-up ms integer packet duration.  For TSVCIS, this
     corresponds to the following values: 23, 45, 68, 90, 112, 135,
     156, and 180.  Larger values can be used as long as they are
     properly rounded.  See Section 6 of RFC 4566 [RFC4566].

  maxptime: the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) that can be
     encapsulated in a packet.  It SHALL use the nearest rounded-up
     ms integer packet duration.  For TSVCIS, this corresponds to
     the following values: 23, 45, 68, 90, 112, 135, 156, and 180.
     Larger values can be used as long as they are properly rounded.
     See Section 6 of RFC 4566 [RFC4566].

  bitrate: specifies the MELPe coder bitrates supported.  Possible
     values are a comma-separated list of rates from the following
     set: 2400, 1200, 600.  The modes are listed in order of
     preference; the first is preferred.  If "bitrate" is not present,
     the fixed coder bitrate of 2400 MUST be used.

  tcmax: specifies the TSVCIS maximum value for the TC supported or
     desired, ranging from 1 to 255.  If "tcmax" is not present, a
     default value of 35 is used.

  Channels:
     1

Encoding considerations: This media subtype is framed and binary; see
  Section 4.8 of RFC 6838 [RFC6838].

Security considerations: Please see Section 8 of RFC 8817 [RFC8817].

Interoperability considerations: N/A

Published specification: [TSVCIS]

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: The media subtype depends on RTP framing and
  hence is only defined for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport
  within other framing protocols is not defined at this time.
