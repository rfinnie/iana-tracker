(RFC 4788 published January 2007, subtype last updated January 2007)

Type name:  audio

Subtype names:  EVRCB1

Required parameters:  none

Optional parameters:

   ptime:  see RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-37.

   maxptime:  The maximum amount of media that can be encapsulated in
      each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  The time MUST
      be calculated as the sum of the time the media present in the
      packet represents.  The time SHOULD be a multiple of the
      duration of a single codec data frame (20 msec).  If not
      signaled, the default maxptime value MUST be 200 milliseconds.

   fixedrate:  Indicates the EVRC-B rate of the session while in
      single-rate operation.  Valid values include: 0.5 and 1, where
      a value of 0.5 indicates the 1/2 rate while a value of 1
      indicates the full rate.  If this parameter is not present, 1/2
      rate is assumed.

   silencesupp:  see Section 6.1 for definition.  If this parameter
      is not present, the default value 1 MUST be assumed.

   dtxmax:  see Section 6.1

   dtxmin:  see Section 6.1

   hangover:  see Section 6.1

Encoding considerations:
   This media type is framed binary data (see RFC 4288, Section 4.8)
   and is defined for transfer of EVRC-B-encoded data via RTP using
   the compact bundled format as described in RFC 4788.

Security considerations:  See Section 9 of RFC 4788.

Interoperability considerations:  none.

Published specification:
   The EVRC-B vocoder is specified in 3GPP2 C.S0014-B [3].  Transfer
   method with compact bundled RTP format is specified in RFC 4788.

Applications that use this media type:
   It is expected that many VoIP applications (as well as mobile
   applications) will use this type.

Additional information:  none

Intended usage:  COMMON

Restrictions on usage:
   This media type depends on RTP framing; hence, it is only defined
   for transfer via RTP (RFC 3550 [5]).  Transfer within other
   framing protocols is not defined at this time.
