Magic number(s): The first four bytes, 0x4f 0x67 0x67 0x53,

Macintosh File Type Code(s): OggA

Person & Email address to contact for further information: See
"Authors' Addresses" section.

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: The type "audio/ogg" SHOULD be used when the
Ogg bitstream predominantly contains audio data.  Content served
under the "audio/ogg" type SHOULD have an Ogg Skeleton logical
bitstream when using the default .oga file extension.  The .ogg and
.spx file extensions indicate a specialization that requires no
Skeleton due to backward compatibility concerns with existing
implementations.  In particular, .ogg is used for Ogg files that
contain only a Vorbis bitstream, while .spx is used for Ogg files
that contain only a Speex bitstream.
