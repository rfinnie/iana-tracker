Type name: audio

Subtype names: MELP, MELP2400, MELP1200, and MELP600

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters:

   ptime: the recommended length of time (in milliseconds)
      represented by the media in a packet.  It SHALL use the nearest
      rounded-up ms integer packet duration.  For MELPe, this
      corresponds to the following values: 23, 45, 68, 90, 112, 135,
      156, and 180.  Larger values can be used as long as they are
      properly rounded.  See Section 6 of RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-37.

   maxptime: the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) that can be
      encapsulated in a packet.  It SHALL use the nearest rounded-up
      ms integer packet duration.  For MELPe, this corresponds to the
      following values: 23, 45, 68, 90, 112, 135, 156, and 180.
      Larger values can be used as long as they are properly rounded.
      See Section 6 of RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-37.

   bitrate: specifies the MELPe coder bitrates supported.  Possible
      values are a comma-separated list of rates from the following
      set: 2400, 1200, 600.  The modes are listed in order of
      preference; first is preferred.  If "bitrate" is not present,
      the fixed coder bitrate of 2400 MUST be used.  The alternate
      encoding names "MELP2400", "MELP1200", and "MELP600" directly
      specify the MELPe coder bitrates of 2400, 1200, and 600,
      respectively, and MUST NOT specify a "bitrate" parameter.

Encoding considerations: These media subtypes are framed and binary;
   see Section 4.8 of RFC 6838.

Security considerations: Please see Section 8 of RFC 8130.

Interoperability considerations: Early implementations used MELP2400,
   MELP1200, and MELP600 to indicate both coder type and bitrate.
   These media type names should be preserved with this registration.

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: These media subtypes depend on RTP framing and
   hence are only defined for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport
   within other framing protocols is not defined at this time.
