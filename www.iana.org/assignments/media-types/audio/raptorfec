(RFC 6682 published August 2012, subtype last updated August 2012)

Type name: audio

Subtype name: raptorfec

Required parameters:

o  rate: The RTP timestamp (clock) rate.  The RTP timestamp (clock)
   rate is specified in Hz and the format is unsigned integer.

o  raptor-scheme-id: The value of this parameter is the FEC Scheme ID
   for the specific Raptor FEC Scheme that will be used as defined in
   [RFC6681].

o  Kmax: The value of this parameter is the FEC Framework
   Configuration Information element, MSBL, as defined in [RFC6681],
   encoded as a unsigned integer.  For specific requirements for this
   value, refer to [RFC6681].

o  T: The value of this parameter is the FEC Framework Configuration
   Information element, encoding symbol size, as defined in
   [RFC6681], encoded as a unsigned integer.  For specific
   requirements for this value, refer to [RFC6681].

o  repair-window: The maximum time that spans the source packets and
   the corresponding repair packets.  The size of the repair window
   is specified in microseconds and the format is unsigned integer.

Optional parameters:

o  P: The value of this parameter is the FEC Framework Configuration
   Information element, Payload ID Format, as defined in [RFC6681].
   The default value of this parameter (when it does not appear
   explicitly) is 'A'.

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: This media type depends on RTP framing, and
hence is only defined for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport
within other framing protocols is not defined at this time.
