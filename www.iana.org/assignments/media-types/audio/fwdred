(RFC6354 published August 2011)

Type names: audio, text

Subtype names: fwdred

Required parameters:

   rate: as defined in [RFC4102].

   pt: as defined in [RFC4102].

   forwardshift: An unsigned integer can be specified as the value.

      If this parameter has a value greater than '0', it indicates
      that the sender of this parameter will use forward-shifting
      with a base value as specified when sending out redundant data.
      This value is in RTP timestamp units.

      If this parameter has a value of '0', it indicates that the
      sender of this parameter will not use forward-shifting when
      sending its redundant data; i.e., the sender will have the same
      behaviors as defined in RFC 2198.

Optional parameters:

   ptime: as defined in [RFC4102] [RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-37].

   maxptime: as defined in [RFC4102] [RFC4867].

Encoding considerations:

   This media type is framed binary data (see RFC 4288, Section 4.8)
   and is only defined for transfer of RTP redundant data frames
   specified in RFC 2198.

Security considerations: See Section 6 of RFC 2198.

Interoperability considerations: none.

Published specification:

   RTP redundant data frame format is specified in RFC 2198.

Applications that use this media type:

   It is expected that real-time audio/video, text streaming, and
   conferencing tools/applications that want protection against
   losses of a large number of consecutive frames will be interested
   in using this type.

Additional information: none.

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage:

   This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
   for transfer via RTP (RFC 3550 [RFC3550]).  Transfer within other
   framing protocols is not defined at this time.
