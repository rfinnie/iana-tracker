Media type name: audio

Media subtype name: sofa

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary. Audio/sofa follows specifications of
   AES69/SOFA. The binary format is represented by the specifications
   of HDF5.

Security considerations: AES69/SOFA is a tagged data format, and some
   tags are available for private use. As such, while arbitrary 
   material could potentially be transferred in the audio/sofa 
   object, the AES69/SOFA specifications do not describe any active 
   or executive material. An audio/sofa object is used by an 
   application to parameterize audio-related signal processing 
   algorithms. These algorithms must be tested to safely work with 
   any parameters, regardless of the content of an audio/sofa object 
   because it can provide parameters being outside the AES69/SOFA 
   specifications. Thus applications must take care of not causing 
   buffer overflows, stack overflows, or out-of-memory errors.

   Audio/sofa objects are not signed or encrypted internally.

   The payload contains compressed data which is decompressed by the 
   library HDF5. HDF5 is specified in 
   [https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html] and its 
   mime type is "application/x-hdf". Thus, the security 
   considerations applicable to "application/x-hdf" are the basis of 
   security conditions for AES69/SOFA.

   No external confidentiality and integrity protection services are 
   required.

Interoperability considerations: Audio/sofa objects are based on 
   HDF5, thus all considerations of HDF5 apply to audio/sofa. HDF5 
   and thus audio/sofa has proven to be widely interoperable across 
   computer platforms.

Published specification:

Applications which use this media: AES69/SOFA is device-, platform- 
   and vendor-neutral and is supported by a wide range of 
   applications.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: N/A

Provisional registration? (standards tree only): N/A

Additional information:

   1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A

   2. Magic number(s): 89 48 44 46 0d 0a 1a 0a (hex), as with HDF5

   3. File extension(s): sofa

   4. Macintosh file type code: unknown

   5. Object Identifiers: unknown

Intended usage: Common. Use for providing spatially oriented data in 
   the field of acoustics. Typical usage is the description of 
   filters for 3D loudspeaker-based audio rendering or spatialization 
   for 3D spatial headphone-based reproduction.

General Comments: Specifications of audio/sofa are described by 
   AES69, a standard of the Audio Engineering Society (551 Fifth 
   Ave., Suite 1225, New York, NY 10176, USA, http://www.aes.org). 
   The AES69 is described at 
   http://www.aes.org/publications/standards/search.cfm?docID=99. The 
   AES69 is widely known as SOFA (spatially oriented format for 
   acoustics), thus in the context of this document, we refer to 
   AES69/SOFA.

   A narrative description of AES69/SOFA and collections of files and 
   applications can be found at https://www.sofaconventions.org/. An 
   introduction to SOFA applicable for more general audience is 
   provided at 
   https://www.hdfgroup.org/2017/04/hdf5-under-the-sofa-hdf5-on-embedded-and-mobile-devices/. 
   A widely used library implementing read access to audio/sofa is 
   available at https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa.
