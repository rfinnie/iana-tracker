(RFC 3557 published July 2003, subtype last updated July 2003)

Media Type name: audio

Media subtype name: dsr-es201108

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:

rate: Indicates the sample rate of the speech.  Valid values include:
  8000, 11000, and 16000.  If this parameter is not present, 8000
  sample rate is assumed.

maxptime: The maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated in
  each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  The time shall be
  calculated as the sum of the time the media present in the packet
  represents.  The time SHOULD be a multiple of the frame pair size
  (i.e., one FP <-> 20ms).

  If this parameter is not present, maxptime is assumed to be 80ms.

  Note, since the performance of most speech recognizers are
  extremely sensitive to consecutive FP losses, if the user of the
  payload format expects a high packet loss ratio for the session,
  it MAY consider to explicitly choose a maxptime value for the
  session that is shorter than the default value.

ptime: see RFC2327 [RFC2327].

Encoding considerations : This type is defined for transfer via RTP
  [RFC3550] as described in Sections 3 and 4 of RFC 3557.

Security considerations : See Section 6 of RFC 3557.
