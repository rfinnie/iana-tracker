(registered in RFC5391)

Type name: audio

Subtype name: PCMU-WB

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:

   mode-set:  restricts the active codec mode-set to a subset of all
      modes.  Possible values are a comma-separated list of modes
      from the set: 1, 2, 3, 4 (see Mode Index in Table 3 of RFC
      5391).  The modes are listed in order of preference; first is
      preferred.  If mode-set is specified, frames encoded with modes
      outside of the subset MUST NOT be sent in any RTP payload.  If
      not present, all codec modes are allowed.

   ptime:  the recommended length of time (in milliseconds)
      represented by the media in a packet.  It should be an integer
      multiple of 5 ms (the frame size).  See Section 6 of 
      RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-37.

   maxptime:  the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) that can
      be encapsulated in a packet.  It should be an integer multiple
      of 5 ms (the frame size).  See Section 6 of 
      RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-37.

Encoding considerations: This media type is framed and contains
   binary data.  See Section 4.8 of RFC 4288.

Security considerations: See Section 8 of RFC 5391.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: RFC 5391

Applications that use this media type: Audio and video conferencing
   tools.

Additional information: none

Restrictions on usage: This media type depends on RTP framing, and
   hence is only defined for transfer via RTP.
