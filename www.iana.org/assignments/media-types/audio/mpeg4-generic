(RFC 3640 published November 2003, subtype last updated June 2011 per RFC 6295)

Media type name:

   audio

Subtype name:

   mpeg4-generic

Required parameters:

   The mode parameter is required by [RFC3640].  [RFC3640]
   requests a repository for mode so that new values for mode
   may be added.  We request that the value rtp-midi be
   added to the mode repository.

   In mode rtp-midi, the mpeg4-generic parameter rate is
   a required parameter.  Rate specifies the RTP timestamp
   clock rate.  See Sections 2.1 and 6.2 for usage details
   of rate in mode rtp-midi.

Optional parameters:

   We request registration of the following parameters
   for use in mode rtp-midi for mpeg4-generic.

   Non-extensible parameters:

	  ch_anchor:    See Appendix C.2.3 for usage details.
	  ch_default:   See Appendix C.2.3 for usage details.
	  ch_never:     See Appendix C.2.3 for usage details.
	  cm_unused:    See Appendix C.1 for usage details.
	  cm_used:      See Appendix C.1 for usage details.
	  chanmask:     See Appendix C.6.4.3 for usage details.
	  cid:          See Appendix C.6.3 for usage details.
	  guardtime:    See Appendix C.4.2 for usage details.
	  inline:       See Appendix C.6.3 for usage details.
	  linerate:     See Appendix C.3 for usage details.
	  mperiod:      See Appendix C.3 for usage details.
	  multimode:    See Appendix C.6.1 for usage details.
	  musicport:    See Appendix C.5 for usage details.
	  octpos:       See Appendix C.3 for usage details.
	  rinit:        See Appendix C.6.3 for usage details.
	  rtp_maxptime: See Appendix C.4.1 for usage details.
	  rtp_ptime:    See Appendix C.4.1 for usage details.
	  smf_cid:      See Appendix C.6.4.2 for usage details.
	  smf_inline:   See Appendix C.6.4.2 for usage details.
	  smf_url:      See Appendix C.6.4.2 for usage details.
	  tsmode:       See Appendix C.3 for usage details.
	  url:          See Appendix C.6.3 for usage details.

   Extensible parameters:

	  j_sec:        See Appendix C.2.1 for usage details.
					See Section 11.2.1 for repository details.
	  j_update:     See Appendix C.2.2 for usage details.
					See Section 11.2.1 for repository details.
	  render:       See Appendix C.6 for usage details.
					See Section 11.2.1 for repository details.
	  subrender:    See Appendix C.6.2 for usage details.
					See Section 11.2.1 for repository details.
	  smf_info:     See Appendix C.6.4.1 for usage details.
					See Section 11.2.1 for repository details.

Encoding considerations:

   The format for this type is framed and binary.

Restrictions on usage:

   Only defined for real-time transfers of audio/mpeg4-generic
   RTP streams with mode=rtp-midi.

Security considerations:

   See Section 9 of RFC 6295.

Interoperability considerations:

   Except for the marker bit (Section 2.1), the packet formats
   for audio/rtp-midi and audio/mpeg4-generic (mode rtp-midi)
   are identical.  The formats differ in use: audio/mpeg4-generic
   is for MPEG work, and audio/rtp-midi is for all other work.

Published specification:

   RFC 6295, [MIDI], and [MPEGSA] are the normative references.
   In addition, [NMP], [GRAME], and [RFC4696] provide
   non-normative implementation guidance.

Applications that use this media type:

   MPEG 4 servers and terminals that support [MPEGSA].

Additional information:

   None.
