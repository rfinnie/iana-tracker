(RFC 4298 published December 2005, subtype last updated December 2005)

MIME media type name: audio

MIME media subtype name: BV32

Required parameter: none

Optional parameters:
  ptime:    Defined as usual for RTP audio (see RFC 2327 [4]).

  maxptime: See RFC 3267 [7] for its definition.  The maxptime
	 SHOULD be a multiple of the duration of a single codec data
	 frame (5 ms).

Encoding considerations:
  This type is defined for transferring BV32-encoded data via RTP
  using the payload format specified in Section 4 of RFC 4298.
  Audio data is binary data and must be encoded for non-binary
  transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable for Email.

Security considerations:
  See Section 7 "Security Considerations" of RFC 4298.

Intended usage:
  COMMON.  It is expected that many VoIP applications, especially
  Voice over Cable applications, will use this type.
