(RFC 4613 published September 2006, subtype last updated September 2006)

Type name:                         audio

Subtype name:                      dls

Required parameters:               None

Optional parameters:               'dls-type'
								  A comma-separated list of the
								  dls types (one or more) that the
								  file content conforms to.  The
								  following values are specified:
								  0, 1, and 2 signify Downloadable
								  Sounds Level 1.1b content,
								  Downloadable Sounds Level 2.1
								  content, and Mobile Downloadable
								  Sound content, respectively.  All
								  types that the content conforms
								  to should be indicated.  Further
								  values (integers) may be
								  specified in the future, and any
								  unknown values shall be ignored.
								  If the parameter is not
								  specified, it corresponds to a
								  value equal to 0; i.e., the
								  content conforms to Downloadable
								  Sound level 1.1b.

Encoding considerations:           DLS files are binary and should
								  be transmitted in a suitable
								  encoding without CR/LF
								  conversion, 7-bit stripping
								  etc.; base64 [RFC3548] is a
								  suitable encoding.

Security considerations:           see the security considerations
								  in Section 2 of RFC 4613.

Interoperability considerations:   This media type is for
								  consumption by a MIDI player
								  capable of utilizing
								  downloadable sounds for its
								  synthesizers.  A general-purpose
								  audio player will not be capable
								  of utilizing the audio within
								  the format without explicit
								  support of the format.

Published specification:           Downloadable Sounds Level 1.1b
								  [DLS1], Downloadable Sounds
								  Level 2.1 [DLS2], and Mobile
								  Downloadable Sounds [MDLS].  MMA
								  specifications can be ordered
								  from the MMA web site,
								  www.midi.org.

Applications that use this media type: Multi-media

Additional information:

  Magic number(s):                The ninth to twelfth bytes of
								  the file must equal (in
								  hexadecimal notation) 44, 4c,
								  53, and 20, respectively.
  File extension(s):              .dls is declared at
								  http://www.nist.gov/nics
