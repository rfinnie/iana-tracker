(RFC 3555 published July 2003)

MIME media type name: audio

MIME subtype name: MPA (MPEG audio)

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters:
     layer: which layer of MPEG audio encoding; permissible values
     are 1, 2, 3.

     samplerate: the rate at which audio is sampled.  MPEG-1 audio
     supports sampling rates of 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz; MPEG-2
     supports sampling rates of 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz.  This parameter
     is separate from the RTP timestamp clock rate which is always
     90000 Hz for MPA.

     mode: permissible values are "stereo", "joint_stereo",
     "single_channel", "dual_channel".  The "channels" parameter
     does not apply to MPA.  It is undefined to put a number of
     channels in the SDP rtpmap attribute for MPA.

     bitrate: the data rate for the audio bit stream.

     ptime: RECOMMENDED duration of each packet in milliseconds.

     maxptime: maximum duration of each packet in milliseconds.

     Parameters which are omitted are left to the encoder to choose
     based on the session bandwidth, configuration information, or
     other constraints.  The selected layer as well as the sampling
     rate and mode are indicated in the payload so receivers can
     process the data without these parameters being specified
     externally.

Encoding considerations:
     This type is only defined for transfer via RTP [RFC 3550].

Security considerations: See Section 5 of RFC 3555

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: RFC 3551

Applications which use this media type:
     Audio and video streaming and conferencing tools.

Additional information: none
