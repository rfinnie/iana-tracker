(RFC 4393 published March 2006, subtype last updated March 2006. 
RFC 6381 does not contain a registration template.)

   MIME media type name:
       audio
   MIME subtype name:
       3gpp2
   Required parameters:
       None.
   Optional parameters:
       Codecs. See [Bucket].  If the audio/3gpp2 body part contains
       another container format, the Codecs parameter MUST list all
       codecs indicated by all formats, including any contained formats.
   Optional parameter values:
       [3gpp2]
   Encoding considerations:
       This data is binary and should be transmitted in a suitable
       encoding without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping, etc.; base64
       is a suitable encoding.  Note that this MIME type is used only
       for files; separate types are used for real-time transfer, such
       as for the RTP payload format for 13K vocoder speech [RFC2658].
   Security considerations:
       See the security considerations section in RFC 4393 (this
       document).
   Interoperability considerations:
       The 3GPP2 organization has defined the specification of the media
       format [3gpp2].  Interoperability and conformance testing is done
       in cooperation with other bodies, including the Open Mobile
       Alliance (OMA) <http://www.openmobilealliance.org> and the
       International Multimedia Telecommunications Consortium (IMTC)
       <http://www.imtc.org/>.
   Published specification:
       3GPP2 C.S0045, 3GPP2 C.S0050 [3gpp2]
       3GPP2 specifications are publicly accessible at the 3GPP2 web
       site, <http://www.3gpp2.org>.
   Applications that use this media type:
       Multi-media
   Additional information:
       The type "audio/3gpp2" MAY be used for files containing audio but
       no visual presentation.  Files served under this type MUST NOT
       contain any visual material.  (Note that 3GPP timed text is
       visually presented and is considered visual material).
   Magic number(s):
       None.  However, the file-type box must occur first in the file,
       and MUST contain a 3GPP2 brand in its compatible brands list.
   File extension(s):
       3g2 and 3gpp2 are both declared at <http://www.nist.gov/nics/>;
       3g2 is preferred.
   Macintosh file type code(s):
       '3gp2'
