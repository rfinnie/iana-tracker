(RFC 4040 published April 2005, subtype last updated April 2005)

MIME media type name: audio

MIME subtype name: clearmode

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: ptime, maxptime

		 "ptime" gives the length of time in milliseconds
		 represented by the media in a packet, as described in RFC
		 2327 [6].

		 "maxptime" represents the maximum amount of media, which
		 can be encapsulated in each packet, expressed as time in
		 milliseconds, as described in RFC 3267 [9].

Encoding considerations:

		 This type is only defined for transfer via RTP [4].

Security considerations:

		 See Section 6 of RFC 4040

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: RFC 4040

Applications, which use this media type:

		 Voice over IP Media Gateways, transferring "ISDN 64 kb/s
		 data", "ISDN 7 kHz voice", or other 64 kbit/s data streams
		 via an RTP connection

		 Note: the choice of the "audio" top-level MIME type was
		 made because the dominant uses of this pseudo-codec are
		 expected to telephony and voice-gateway-related.  The
		 "audio" type allows the use of sharing of the port in the
		 SDP "m=" line with codecs such as audio/g711 [6], [7], for
		 one example.  This sharing is an important application and
		 would not be possible otherwise.

Additional information: none

Intended usage: COMMON
