(RFC 3190 published January 2002, subtype last updated January 2002)

MIME media type name: audio

MIME subtype name: L20

Required parameters:
  rate: number of samples per second -- RECOMMENDED values for rate
	 are 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 24000, 32000, 44100 and 48000
	 samples per second.  Other values are permissible.

Optional parameters:
  channels: how many audio streams are interleaved -- defaults to 1;
	 stereo would be 2, etc.  Interleaving takes place between
	 individual 20-bit samples.

  emphasis: analog preemphasis applied to the data before
	 quantization.  The only emphasis value defined here is
	 emphasis=50-15 to indicate 50/15 microsecond preemphasis.  This
	 parameter MUST be omitted if no analog preemphasis was applied.

  channel-order: specifies the sample interleaving order for
	 multiple-channel audio streams (see RFC 3190 Section 7).
	 Permissible values are DV.LRLsRs, DV.LRCS, DV.LRCWo,
	 DV.LRLsRsC, DV.LRLsRsCS, DV.LmixRmixTWoQ1Q2,
	 DV.LRCWoLsRsLmixRmix, DV.LRCWoLs1Rs1Ls2Rs2, DV.LRCWoLsRsLcRc.
	 For interoperation with DV video systems, none of these channel
	 combinations is specified for use with 20-bit linear encoding
	 in the DV video specification [4]; only mono and stereo are
	 allowed.  This parameter MUST be omitted when the AIFF-C
	 channel order convention is in use.

Encoding considerations:
  L20 audio can be transmitted with RTP as specified in RFC 3190.

Security considerations: See Section 9.

Interoperability considerations: NONE

Published specification:
  RFC 3190.

Applications which use this media type:
