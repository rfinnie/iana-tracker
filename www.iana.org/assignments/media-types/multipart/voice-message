(per RFC 3801)

MIME media type name: multipart

MIME subtype name: voice-message

Required parameters: boundary, version

   The use of boundary is defined in RFC 2046

   The version parameter that contains the value "2.0" if
   enclosed content conforms to RFC 3801.  The absence of this
   parameter indicates conformance to the previous version
   defined in RFC 1911.

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: 7bit, 8bit or Binary

Security considerations:

   This definition identifies the content as being a voice
   message.  In some environments (though likely not the
   majority), the loss of the anonymity of the content may be a
   security issue.

Interoperability considerations:

   Systems developed to conform with RFC 1911 may not conform to
   this registration.  Specifically, the required version will
   likely be absent, in this case the recipient system should
   still be able to accept the message and will be able to
   handle the content.  The VPIM v1 positional identification,
   however, would likely be lost.

Published specification:
   RFC 3801

Applications that use this media type:

   Primarily voice messaging
