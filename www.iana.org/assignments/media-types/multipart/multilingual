Media Type name: multipart

Media subtype name: multilingual

Required parameters: boundary (defined in RFC 2046)

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: There are no encoding considerations for
	this multipart other than that of the embedded body parts. 
	The embedded body parts (typically one 'text/plain' plus one or 
	more 'message/*') may contain 7-bit, 8-bit, or binary encodings.

Security considerations: See the Security Considerations section
                         in RFC 8255

Interoperability considerations:
	Existing systems that do not treat unknown multipart subtypes
	as 'multipart/mixed' may not correctly render a
	'multipart/multilingual' type. These systems would also be non-
	compliant with MIME.
