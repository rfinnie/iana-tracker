Type name: text

Subtype name: shaclc

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: 8bit.

   Note: SHACL Compact Syntax (SHACLC) is a text language encoded in 
   UTF-8.

Security considerations: Revealing the structure of an RDF graph can 
   reveal information about the content of conformant data. For 
   instance, a schema with a predicate to describe cancer stage 
   indicates that conforming graphs describe patients with cancer.

   The process of testing a graph's conformance to a schema could 
   draw significant system resources and be a vector for Denial of 
   Service attacks.

   The format does not allow any executable or active content.

   RDF Turtle security considerations about IRI spoofing may also 
   apply here: https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#sec-mediaReg

Interoperability considerations: Not Applicable

Published specification:

Applications that use this media type: An implementations of SHACLC 
   is part of the TopQuadrant SHACL API

Additional information:

   Magic number(s): SHACLC documents will likely have the words 
      PREFIX or BASE (case sensitive) near the beginning of the 
      document. However, the same words may appear in Turtle and 
      SPARQL documents.

   File extension(s): .shaclc, .shc
