The Text/SGML media-type can be employed when the contents of the
SGML entity is intended to be read by a human and is in a readily
comprehensible form.  That is the content can be easily discerned by
someone without SGML display software.  Each record in the SGML
entity, delimited by record start (RS) and record end (RE) codes,
must correspond to a line in the Text/SGML body part.

SGML entities that do not meet the above requirements should use the
Application/SGML media-type.

See section 2.3 for a description of the parameters.
