Encoding considerations : 8-bit. The CSV Schema language is expressed in UTF-8 text.

Security considerations : 
This is a human readable text based format that can also be interpreted by applications to validate CSV data. It does have directives for accessing files that are referenced by CSV files, however it is assumed that the security of such will be controlled by the parsing Application and ultimately the underlying Operating System. The format contains no executable content. The format provides no integrity or privacy protection, so if this is needed it must be supplied externally.

Interoperability considerations : 
None known.
