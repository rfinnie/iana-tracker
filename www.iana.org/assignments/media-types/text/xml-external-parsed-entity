Type name:  text

Subtype name:  xml-external-parsed-entity

Required parameters:  none

Optional parameters:  charset

   See Section 3 of RFC7303.

Encoding considerations:  Same as for application/xml (Section 9.1 of
   RFC7303).

Security considerations:  See Section 10 of RFC7303.

Interoperability considerations:  XML external parsed entities are as
   interoperable as XML documents, though they have a less tightly
   constrained structure and therefore need to be referenced by XML
   documents for proper handling by XML processors.  Similarly, XML
   documents cannot be reliably used as external parsed entities
   because external parsed entities are prohibited from having
   standalone document declarations or DTDs.  Identifying XML
   external parsed entities with their own content type enhances
   interoperability of both XML documents and XML external parsed
   entities.

Published specification:  Same as for application/xml (Section 9.1 of 
   RFC7303).

Applications which use this media type:  Same as for application/xml
