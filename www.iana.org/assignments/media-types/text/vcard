(per RFC6350)

Type name:  text

Subtype name:  vcard

Required parameters:  none

Optional parameters:  version

   The "version" parameter is to be interpreted identically as the
   VERSION vCard property.  If this parameter is present, all vCards
   in a text/vcard body part MUST have a VERSION property with value
   identical to that of this MIME parameter.

   "charset": as defined for text/plain [RFC2046]; encodings other
   than UTF-8 [RFC3629] MUST NOT be used.

Encoding considerations:  8bit

Security considerations:  See Section 9.

Interoperability considerations:  The text/vcard media type is
   intended to identify vCard data of any version.  There are older
   specifications of vCard [RFC2426][vCard21] still in common use.
   While these formats are similar, they are not strictly compatible.
   In general, it is necessary to inspect the value of the VERSION
   property (see Section 6.7.9) for identifying the standard to which
   a given vCard object conforms.

   In addition, the following media types are known to have been used
   to refer to vCard data.  They should be considered deprecated in
   favor of text/vcard.

   *  text/directory
   *  text/directory; profile=vcard
   *  text/x-vcard

Published specification:  RFC 6350

Applications that use this media type:  They are numerous, diverse,
   and include mail user agents, instant messaging clients, address
   book applications, directory servers, and customer relationship
   management software.
