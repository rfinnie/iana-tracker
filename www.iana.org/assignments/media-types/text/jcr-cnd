Files of this media type define node types in JCR-compliant content
repositories. Nodes are the structural components that make up the
content storage in a JCR repository. A node type defines the
characteristics that a node can have. Files of this media type are
typically processed by a repository, thus registering the defined node
types, making them available to users of the repository. Files of this
media type are typically referred to as Compact Node Type Definition
files or CND files.
