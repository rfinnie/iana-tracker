Optional parameters :

The charset parameter can be used to specify the charset encoding of the

if 8 bit bytes are encountered. If no 8 bit bytes are encountered, then
us-ascii will be assumed.

Encoding considerations : 8bit

Security considerations :
the security issues associated with this type have not been assessed

Interoperability considerations :

Local file paths can create problems when a text/vnd.a file is exchanged 
between a windows system and a non-windows system.

If a text file is not utf-8 encoded, has not specified a charset and 
contains characters that uses the 8th bit, undefined behavior will happen
