(per RFC2318)

MIME media type name: text

MIME subtype name: css

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: charset

The syntax of CSS is expressed in US-ASCII, but a CSS file can
contain strings which may use any Unicode character. Any charset
that is a superset of US-ASCII may be used; US-ASCII, iso-8859-X
and utf-8 are recommended.

Encoding considerations:

For use with transports that are not 8-bit clean, quoted-
printable encoding is recommended since the majority of
characters will be CSS syntax and thus US-ASCII

Security considerations:

Applying a style sheet to a document may hide information
otherwise visible. For example, a very small font size may be
specified, or the display of certain document elements may be
turned off.

CSS style sheets consist of declarative property/value pairs
assigned to element selectors. They contain no executable code.

As with HTML documents, CSS style sheets may contain links to
other media (images, sounds, fonts, other style sheets) and those
links are typically followed automatically by software, resulting

in the transfer of files without the explicit request of the user
for each one. The security considerations of each linked file are
those of the individual registered types.

Interoperability considerations:

CSS has proven to be widely interoperable across computer
platforms, across Web browsers of different makes, and for import
and export in multiple authoring tools.

Published specification: see [1]

Applications which use this media type:

CSS is device-, platform- and vendor-neutral and is supported by
a wide range of Web user agents and authoring tools for
formatting HTML and XML documents.
