MIME media type name: text

MIME subtype name: parityfec

Required parameters: none

    Note that [3] mandates that RTP payload formats without a
    defined rate must define a rate parameter as part of their
    MIME registration.  The payload format for generic forward
    error correction [1] does not specify a rate parameter.
    However, the rate for FEC data is equal to the rate of the
    media data it protects.

Optional parameters: none

    Typical optional parameters [3], such as the number of
    channels, and the duration of audio per packet, do not
    apply to FEC data.  The number of channels is effectively
    the same as the media data it protects; the same is true
    for the duration of text per packet.

Encoding considerations: This format is only defined for
    transport within the Real Time Transport protocol (RTP)
    [4,5].  Its transport within RTP is fully specified with RFC
    2733 [1].

Security considerations: the same security considerations
    apply to these MIME registrations as to the payloads for
    for them, as detailed in RFC 2733.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: This MIME type is described fully
    within RFC 2733 [1].

Applications which use this media type: Audio, video and text
    streaming tools which seek to improve resiliency to loss by
    sending additional data with the media stream.

Intended usage: COMMON

Author/Change controller: This registration is part of the IETF
    registration tree.

RTP and SDP Issues: Usage of this format within RTP and the
    Session Description Protocol (SDP) [6] are fully specified
    within RFC 2733 [1].
