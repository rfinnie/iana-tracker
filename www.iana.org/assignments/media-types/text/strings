Media type name: text
Media subtype name: strings

Required parameters: NONE

Optional parameters:
NONE

Encoding considerations: 8bit
UTF-8 encoded Unicode text.

Security considerations:
Localized strings do not contain executable or active content, and do not need privacy services since the same information is intended to be provided to all users of a specific language group. Integrity of the strings must be provided by the transport protocol, for example using HTTP over TLS (HTTPS).

Localized strings may be arbitrarily large and could potentially cause a denial-of-service. Localized strings may also contain printf-style format characters that could cause a program to display unintended information or crash.

Interoperability considerations:
NONE
