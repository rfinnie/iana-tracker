(RFC 6787 published November 2012, subtype last updated November 2012)

MIME media type name:  text

MIME subtype name:  text/grammar-ref-list

Required parameters:  none

Optional parameters:  none

Encoding considerations:  Depending on the transfer protocol, a
   transfer encoding may be necessary to deal with very long lines.

Security considerations:  This media type contains URIs that may
   represent references to external resources.  As these resources
   are assumed to be speech recognition grammars, similar
   considerations as for the media types 'application/srgs' and
   'application/srgs+xml' apply.

Interoperability considerations:  '>' must be percent encoded in URIs
   according to RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

Published specification:  The RECOGNIZE method of the MRCP protocol
   performs a recognition operation that matches input against a set
   of grammars.  When matching against more than one grammar, it is
   sometimes necessary to use different weights for the individual
   grammars.  These weights are not a property of the grammar
   resource itself but qualify the reference to that grammar for the
   particular recognition operation initiated by the RECOGNIZE
   method.  The format of the proposed 'text/grammar-ref-list' media
   type is as follows:

   body       = *reference
   reference  = "<" uri ">" [parameters] CRLF
   parameters = ";" parameter *(";" parameter)
   parameter  = attribute "=" value

   This specification currently only defines a 'weight' parameter,
   but new parameters MAY be added through the "Grammar Reference
   List Parameters" IANA registry established through this
   specification.  Example:

         <http://example.com/grammars/field1.gram>
         <http://example.com/grammars/field2.gram>;weight="0.85"
         <session:field3&form-level.store>;weight="0.9"
         <http://example.com/grammars/universals.gram>;weight="0.75"
