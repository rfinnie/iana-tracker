MIME media type name : Text

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - cache-manifest

Required parameters : No parameters

Optional parameters :

charset
The charset parameter may be provided. The parameter's value must be
"utf-8". This parameter serves no purpose; it is only allowed for
compatibility with legacy servers.

Encoding considerations : 8bit

Security considerations :

Cache manifests themselves contain no executable content and pose no 
immediate risk unless sensitive information is included within the manifest.

Implementations however, are required to follow specific rules when 
populating a cache based on a cache manifest, to ensure that certain 
origin-based restrictions are honoured. Failure to correctly implement 
these rules can result in information leakage, cross-site scripting 
attacks, and the like.

Caching mechanisms are typically subjects of poisoning attacks and the 
one that this file type supports is no exception. The published 
specification includes steps intended to mitigate such issues (notably 
non-malicious cache poisoning from captive portals) but implementers are 
advised to exercise caution in caching.

Additionally, the permanence of this caching mechanism requires care to 
be taken with respect to users' privacy 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html/single-page.html#expiring-application-caches) 
and storage resources 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html/single-page.html#disk-space).

Interoperability considerations :

Rules for generating and processing text/cache-manifest payloads are
defined in the HTML specification.

Published specification :
http://www.w3.org/TR/html is the relevant specification.

Applications which use this media :
Web browsers.

Fragment identifier considerations :
Fragment identifiers have no meaning with the text/cache-manifest type.

Restrictions on usage :
No restrictions apply.

Provisional registration? (standards tree only) :
No.

Additional information :

1. Deprecated alias names for this type : N/A
2. Magic number(s) : "CACHE MANIFEST" followed by [ \t\r\n]
3. File extension(s) : "appcache", "manifest"
4. Macintosh file type code : No specific Macintosh file type codes are
