Type name: text

Subtype name: vtt

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: 8bit (always UTF-8)

Security considerations: Text track files themselves pose no 
   immediate risk unless sensitive information is included within the
   data. Implementations, however, are required to follow specific 
   rules when processing text tracks, to ensure that certain 
   origin-based restrictions are honored. Failure to correctly 
   implement these rules can result in information leakage, 
   cross-site scripting attacks, and the like.

Interoperability considerations: Rules for processing both conforming
   and non-conforming content are defined in this specification.

Published specification: This document is the relevant specification.

Applications that use this media type: Web browsers and other video 
   players.

Additional information:

   EF BB BF 57 45 42 56 54 54 0D
   EF BB BF 57 45 42 56 54 54 20
   EF BB BF 57 45 42 56 54 54 09
   EF BB BF 57 45 42 56 54 54 EOF
   57 45 42 56 54 54 0A
   57 45 42 56 54 54 0D
   57 45 42 56 54 54 20
   57 45 42 56 54 54 09
   57 45 42 56 54 54 EOF

   (An optional UTF-8 BOM, the ASCII string "WEBVTT", and finally a
