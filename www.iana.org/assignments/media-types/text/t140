(per RFC4103, which updates RFC2793 registration)

MIME media type name: text

MIME subtype name: t140

Required parameters: rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate, which is
  equal to the sampling rate.  The only valid value is 1000.

Optional parameters: cps: The maximum number of characters that may
  be received per second.  The default value is 30.

Encoding considerations: T.140 text can be transmitted with RTP as
  specified in RFC 4103.

Security considerations: See Section 8 of RFC 4103.

Interoperability considerations: This format is the same as specified
  in RFC2793.  For RFC2793 the "cps=" parameter was not defined.
  Therefore, there may be implementations that do not consider this
  parameter.  Receivers need to take that into account.

Published specification: ITU-T T.140 Recommendation.  RFC 4103.

Applications which use this media type: Text communication terminals
  and text conferencing tools.

Additional information: This type is only defined for transfer via
  RTP.
