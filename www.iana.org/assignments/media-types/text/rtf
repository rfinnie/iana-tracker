MIME type name: text
MIME subtype name: rtf

Required parameters: none

Optional paramters: none

Encoding Considerations:

  RTF allows one to include files that reside on a local disk.  Use of
  this is forbidden.  All images must be inline.

  RTF uses only 7 bits per octet.

  RTF specifies it's own character set internally, thus character set
  codes are redundant.

Security Considerations:

  RTF does not contain a method of writing data to a users filesystem,
  thus it is a safe method of transmitting files.

Published Specification:

  ftp://indri.primate.wisc.edu/pub/RTF/RTF-Spec.rtf or
  ftp://indri.primate.wisc.edu/pub/RTF/RTF-Spec.hqx
