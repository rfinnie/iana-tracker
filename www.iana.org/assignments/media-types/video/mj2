Encoding considerations:           files are binary and should be
                                   transmitted in a suitable encoding
                                   without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                   stripping etc.; base64 is a suitable
                                   encoding;
Security considerations:           see above
Interoperability considerations:   A number of interoperating
                                   implementations exist within the
                                   MPEG-4 community with the formats
                                   derived from the ISO Base Media File
                                   Format;  and that community has
                                   reference software for reading and
                                   writing the file format.  Reference
                                   software for MJP2 is also available.
