(registered by RFC-ietf-payload-vp8-17)

Type name:  video

Subtype name:  VP8

Required parameters:  None.

Optional parameters:

   These parameters are used to signal the capabilities of a receiver
   implementation.  If the implementation is willing to receive
   media, both parameters MUST be provided.  These parameters MUST
   NOT be used for any other purpose.

   max-fr:  The value of max-fr is an integer indicating the maximum
      frame rate in units of frames per second that the decoder is
      capable of decoding.

   max-fs:  The value of max-fs is an integer indicating the maximum
      frame size in units of macroblocks that the decoder is capable
      of decoding.

      The decoder is capable of decoding this frame size as long as
      the width and height of the frame in macroblocks are less than
      int(sqrt(max-fs * 8)). For instance, a max-fs of 1200 (capable
      of supporting 640x480 resolution) will support widths and
      heights up to 1552 pixels (97 macroblocks).

Encoding considerations:
   This media type is framed in RTP and contains binary data; see
   Section 4.8 of [RFC6838].

Security considerations:  See Section 7 of RFC-ietf-payload-vp8-17.

Interoperability considerations:  None.

Published specification:  VP8 bitstream format [RFC6386] and 
   RFC-ietf-payload-vp8-17.

Applications that use this media type:
   For example: Video over IP, video conferencing.

Fragment identifier considerations:  N/A.

Additional information:  None.

Intended usage:  COMMON

Restrictions on usage:

   This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
   for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].
