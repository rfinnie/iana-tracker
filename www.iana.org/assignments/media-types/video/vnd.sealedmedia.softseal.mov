which makes the unencrypted content available in a very limited fashion to a

algorithms, it is unlikely that the data could be spoofed. The client is also 
designed to refuse to work with data that is corrupt or ill-formed. This data 
does not contain any executable material.

Interoperability considerations : 
This mime-type is valid for Windows systems only.

a convention for labeling this proprietary data type within the MIME/HTTP environment 
and does not specify any details about the content format or semantics, except to refer 
to the software and specifications provided by Sealed Media. Company information may be
