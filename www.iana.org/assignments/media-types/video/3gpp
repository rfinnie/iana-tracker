(RFC 3839 published July 2004, subtype last updated July 2004. 
RFC 6381 does not contain a registration template.)

MIME media type name:              video
MIME subtype name:                 3gpp
Required parameters:               none
Optional parameters:               none
Encoding considerations:           files are binary and should be
                                    transmitted in a suitable encoding
                                    without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                    stripping etc.; base64 is a suitable
                                    encoding.  Note that this MIME type
                                    is used only for files; separate
                                    types are used for real-time
                                    transfer, such as for the RTP
                                    payload formats for H.263
                                    [RFC2429] and AMR audio
                                    [RFC3267].
Security considerations:           see the security considerations
                                    section in RFC 3839
Interoperability considerations:   The 3GPP organization has defined the
                                    specification, interoperability, and
                                    conformance, and conducts regular
                                    interoperability testing.
Published specification:           3GPP 26.234, Release 5; 3GPP 26.244,
                                    Release 6 or later.  3GPP
                                    specifications are publicly
                                    accessible at the 3GPP web site,
                                    www.3gpp.org.
Applications which use this media type: Multi-media
