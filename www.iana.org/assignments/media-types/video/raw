MIME media type name: video

MIME subtype name: raw

Required parameters:

  rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate.  Applications using this
  payload format SHOULD use a value of 90000.

  sampling: Determines the color (sub-)sampling mode of the video
  stream.  Currently defined values are RGB, RGBA, BGR, BGRA,
  YCbCr-4:4:4, YCbCr-4:2:2, YCbCr-4:2:0, and YCbCr-4:1:1.  New values
  may be registered as described in section 6.2 of RFC 4175.
  width: Determines the number of pixels per line.  This is an
  integer between 1 and 32767.

  height: Determines the number of lines per frame.  This is an
  integer between 1 and 32767.

  depth: Determines the number of bits per sample.  This is an
  integer with typical values including 8, 10, 12, and 16.

  colorimetry: This parameter defines the set of colorimetric
  specifications and other transfer characteristics for the video
  source, by reference to an external specification.  Valid values
  and their specification are:

       BT601-5      ITU Recommendation BT.601-5 [601]
       BT709-2      ITU Recommendation BT.709-2 [709]
       SMPTE240M    SMPTE standard 240M [240]

  New values may be registered as described in section 6.2 of RFC
  4175.


Optional parameters:

  Interlace: If this OPTIONAL parameter is present, it indicates that
  the video stream is interlaced.  If absent, progressive scan is
  implied.

  Top-field-first: If this OPTIONAL parameter is present, it
  indicates that chrominance samples are packetized starting with the
  first line of field 0.  Its absence implies that chrominance
  samples are packetized starting with the first line of field 1.

  chroma-position: This OPTIONAL parameter defines the position of
  chrominance samples relative to luminance samples.  It is either a
  single integer or a comma separated pair of integers.  Integer
  values range from 0 to 8, as specified in Figures 6-8 of RFC 4175.
  A single integer implies that Cb and Cr are co-sited.  A comma
  separated pair of integers designates the locations of Cb and Cr
  samples, respectively.  In its absence, a single value of zero is
  assumed for color-subsampled video (chroma-position=0).

  gamma: An OPTIONAL floating point gamma correction value.

Encoding considerations:

  Uncompressed video is only transmitted over RTP as specified in RFC
  4175.  No file format media type has been defined to go with this
  transmission media type at this time.

Security considerations: See section 9 of RFC 4175.

Interoperability considerations: NONE.

Published specification: RFC 4175.

Applications which use this media type: Video communication.
