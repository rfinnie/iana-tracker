(registered by RFC 3555, updated by RFC4629)

Type name: video

Subtype name: H263-2000

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters:

   The optional parameters of the H263-1998 type MAY be used with
   this media subtype.  Specific optional parameters that may be used
   with the H263-2000 type are as follows:

   PROFILE:  H.263 profile number, in the range 0 through 10,
   specifying the supported H.263 annexes/subparts based on H.263
   annex X [H263].  The annexes supported in each profile are listed
   in table X.1 of H.263 annex X.  If no profile or H.263 annex is
   specified, then the stream is Baseline H.263 (profile 0 of H.263
   annex X).

   LEVEL:  Level of bitstream operation, in the range 0 through 100,
   specifying the level of computational complexity of the decoding
   process.  The level are described in table X.2 of H.263 annex X.

   According to H.263 annex X, support of any level other than level
   45 implies support of all lower levels.  Support of level 45
   implies support of level 10.

   A system that specifies support of a PROFILE MUST specify the
   supported LEVEL.

   INTERLACE:  Interlaced or 60 fields indicates the support for
   interlace display mode, as specified in H.263 annex W.6.3.11.
   This parameter, if supported SHALL have the value "1".  If not
   supported, it should not be listed or SHALL have the value "0".

Encoding considerations:

   This media type is framed and binary; see Section 4.8 in [RFC4288]

Security considerations: See Section 11 of RFC 4629

Interoperability considerations:

   The optional parameters PROFILE and LEVEL SHALL NOT be used with
   any of the other optional parameters.

Published specification: RFC 4629

Applications that use this media type:

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage:

   This media type depends on RTP framing and thus is only defined
   for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport within other framing
   protocols is not defined at this time.
