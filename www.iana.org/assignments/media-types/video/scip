Type name: video

Subtype name: scip

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: RTP packets using the payload format defined
   in this specification are subject to the security considerations 
   discussed in the RTP specification [RFC3550] and any appropriate 
   RTP profile.

   As this format transports encoded video, the main security issues 
   include confidentiality, integrity protection, and authentication 
   of the video itself. The payload format itself has built-in 
   security mechanisms.

   This payload format does not exhibit any significant 
   non-uniformity in the receiver-end computational load and thus are
   unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of 
   pathological datagrams.

Interoperability considerations: N/A

Published specification:

   National Security Agency, SCIP-214.2, "Secure Communication
   Interoperability Protocol (SCIP) over Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP)", Revision 1.1, 18 April 2014

   National Security Agency, SCIP-210, "SCIP Signaling Plan",
   Revision 3.10, 26 October 2017

Applications which use this media: SCIP is presently deployed in U.S.
   and NATO secure voice and data products operating on commercial, 
   private, and tactical networks worldwide.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: This media subtype is only defined for 
   transfer via RTP. There must be no encoding/decoding (transcoding)
   of the data stream as it traverses the network.

Additional information:

   1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A

   2. Magic number(s): N/A

   3. File extension(s): N/A

   4. Macintosh file type code: N/A

   5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments: SCIP, the Secure Communication Interoperability 
   Protocol, is an international standard for secure communication. 
   SCIP signaling messages are exchanged between end devices to 
   establish a secure traffic session. The SCIP-214.2 specification 
   is meant to standardize the encapsulation of SCIP messages within 
   the Real-Time Transport Protocol.

   SCIP is presently deployed in U.S. and NATO secure voice and data 
   products operating on commercial, private, and tactical networks 
   worldwide using the scip media subtype. The scip media subtype 
   provides the means through which secure session establishment  
   signaling and secure traffic occur. The built-in negotiation and 
   flexibility provided by the SCIP standards make it a natural 
   choice for many connection scenarios that require encryption.

   The "scip" media subtype is used to indicate support for and 
   identify SCIP traffic, which is being transferred using RTP 
   [RFC3550]. SCIP traffic requires end-to-end bit integrity with no 
   transcoding and no compression over the entire network.

   The data stream within the network, including the VoIP network, 
   must be a transparent relay and be treated as "clear-channel 
   data", similar to that in RFC 4040. However, RFC 4040 is defined 
   for a sample rate of 8000 Hz only. It is not defined for the 
   higher sample rates required for some SCIP traffic (i.e., 
   video/scip at 90000 Hz). SCIP is also similar to RFC 4040 as noted 
   in that No encoder/decoder is needed in that case, but a unique 
   RTP payload type is necessary, and a related Media subtype should 
   be registered for signaling purposes.

   Transport of SCIP information using the scip payload type clearly 
   defines a signaling path. All current IP-based SCIP devices 
   deployed by the U.S. and NATO partners support scip as a media 
   subtype. However, the SCIP standards are not available to the 
   general public. Registration of scip as an IETF registered RTP 
   media subtype provides a globally available common reference for 
   equipment manufacturers. 

   It informs network equipment manufacturers about SCIP protocol and
   its purpose in the context of RTP transport. It enables network 
   equipment manufacturers to include scip as a known audio/video 
   media RTP subtype in their equipment. Registration of SCIP as an 
   RTP media subtype also enables network administrators to define 
   and implement a compatible security policy.
