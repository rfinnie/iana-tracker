Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: The type "video/ogg" SHOULD be used for Ogg
bitstreams containing visual, audio, timed text, or any other type of
material that requires a visual interface.  It is intended for
content not complex enough to warrant serving under "application/
ogg"; for example, a combination of Theora video, Vorbis audio,
Skeleton metadata, and CMML captioning.  Data served under the type
"video/ogg" SHOULD contain an Ogg Skeleton logical bitstream.
Implementations interacting with the type "video/ogg" SHOULD support
multiplexed bitstreams.
