Media type name: model

Media subtype name: e57

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: None.

   The "dimension" parameter with just an integer count would not 
   provide sufficient information for choosing an application to view 
   or edit an e57 file. Beyond 3D coordinates and 2D images, the e57 
   format supports per-point attributes such as color, temperature
   or arbitrary user-defined properties.

   The value of the "state" parameter, if permitted, would always be 
   "static". This is because the typical use of E57 is to capture 
   reality at a given point in time using 3D laser scanners or 
   similar devices), preserving past state.

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: Per their specification, E57 files do not 
   contain executable content. However, in addition to binary data, 
   they contain an XML-encoded stream. Therefore, they have all of 
   the general security considerations presented in section 10 of 
   [RFC7303].

Interoperability considerations: The E57 file format has been 
   implemented by several vendors listed in [LIBE57] 
   https://www.astm.org/Standards/E2807.htm.

Published specification: The E57 specification has been formally 
   standardized in [ASTME2807] 
   https://www.astm.org/Standards/E2807.htm.

   An informal overview is available from [HUBER] 
   https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2011/1/2011-huber-e57-v3.pdf, and 
   there is an open-source implementation in [LIBE57].

Person and email address to contact for further information:
   The contact information for the current chairman of the ASTM E57 
   Committee on Imaging Systems can be found on the astm.org web site.

Applications which use this media: The E57 file format is a compact, 
   vendor-neutral format for storing point clouds, images, and 
   metadata produced by 3D imaging systems such as laser scanners.

Fragment identifier considerations: none

Restrictions on usage: none
