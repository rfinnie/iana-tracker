MIME media type name: image

MIME subtype name: avcs

   This MIME type may be used when the requirements of the 'avcs' 
   brand specified in section E.4.2 of ISO/IEC 23008-12 apply. (A 
   brand in the file header identifies a specific profile of a more 
   general format.)

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:

   profiles: Specified by RFC 6381 and its successors.

   codecs: Specified by RFC 6381 and its successors for files 
      conforming to specifications derived from ISO/IEC 14496-12 and 
      derived specifications. Note that for AVC, the format of a list 
      item included in the value of the codecs parameter is specified 
      in ISO/IEC 14496-15.

      When the codecs parameter is present, the first list item 
      should represent a track having the handler type 'pict'. Other 
      list items represent other tracks.

Encoding considerations: as for video/mp4

Security considerations: See section 4 of RFC 4337 and section 7 of 
   RFC 6381. This format does not supply integrity or confidentiality 
   protection and so they are applied externally when needed.

Interoperability considerations: Interoperably deployed in reference 
   code available from ISO, Javascript code from Nokia labs, in 
   open-source in MP4Box and various other implementations.

Published specification: ISO/IEC 23008-12, available as a Publicly 
   Available Standard at

Applications: Multimedia, Imaging, Pictures

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identifiers are 
   specified in Annex L of ISO/IEC 14496-12, available as a Publicly 
   Available Standard at
