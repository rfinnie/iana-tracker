Media type name: image

Media subtype name: jxs

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: binary
   Files are binary and should be transmitted in a suitable encoding 
   without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping etc.; base64 is a 
   suitable encoding.

Security considerations: The conveyed coded image files defined in 
   Annex A of ISO/IEC 21122-3 use a structure that can store image 
   data, metadata corresponding to this image data, and other 
   user-defined data. The data files have an extensible structure, so
   that it is theoretically possible that metadata fields could be 
   defined in the future that could be used to induce particular 
   actions on the part of the recipient, thus presenting additional 
   security risks, but this type of capability is not supported in 
   the current referenced specifications.

Interoperability considerations: JPEG XS coded image files can 
   conform to one of several profiles and levels of capabilities (as 
   specified in ISO/IEC 21122-2) – not all of which may be supported 
   by a receiving decoder. As a result, implementations may attempt 
   to decode and display an encoded JPEG XS image only to determine 
   that the image cannot be rendered either partially or in full.

Published specifications:
   ISO/IEC 21122-3, Information technology – JPEG XS low-latency 
   lightweight image coding system - Part 3: Transport and container 
   formats

Other general information: It should be noted that selected metadata 
   fields may encompass information partly intended to protect the 
   image against unauthorized use or distribution. In this case, the 
   intention may be that alteration or removal of the data in the 
   fields would be treated as an offence. Metadata fields may also 
   contain information about the source of the image content.
