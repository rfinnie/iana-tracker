(RFC 4047 published April 2005, subtype last updated April 2005)

MIME media type name: image

MIME subtype name: fits

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: binary

FITS files can be quite large. When transferred via HTTP it may be
efficient for the transaction to make use of content-coding or
transfer-coding values such as "gzip", "compress", or "deflate".

Security considerations:

FITS provides a means of transporting arrays and tables of data and
keyword/value pairs of metadata. The standard FITS keywords are
either mandatory or reserved. Mandatory keywords provide information
necessary for correct interpretation of the data; reserved keywords
merely provide standard bits of metadata. As such, the current
standard FITS keywords do not pose security risks.

A FITS file author may insert additional keywords with semantics that
are not described by the standard. Parties exchanging FITS files may
employ locally defined conventions that use various keywords and
their values to induce actions on the part of the recipient. There
are existing local conventions where such keywords are used to
request the reading of other files and/or URIs. There are other
local conventions where such keywords are used to modify the state of
a telescope and/or instrument. The security implications of local
conventions such as these SHOULD be analyzed by the parties employing
them.

Interoperability considerations:

FITS files have been successfully transported between wildly
different computers since 1979. The difficulty most likely to be
encountered by a FITS application is inability to acquire the
computational resources required by a very large FITS file.

At the present time many of the applications listed above are not
designed to support use as viewers of "image/fits" files in
association with web browsers.

Additional information:

A FITS file described with the media type "image/fits" SHOULD have a
PHDU with positive integer values for the NAXIS and NAXISn keywords,
and hence SHOULD contain at least one pixel. Files with 4 or more
non-degenerate axes (NAXISn>1) SHOULD be described as
"application/fits", not as "image/fits". (In rare cases it may be
appropriate to describe a NULL image -- a dataless container for FITS
keywords, with NAXIS=0 or NAXISn=0 -- or an image with 4+ non-
degenerate axes as "image/fits" but this usage is discouraged because
such files may confuse simple image viewer applications.)

FITS files declared as "image/fits" MAY also have one or more
conforming XHDUs following their PHDUs. These extension HDUs MAY
contain standard, non-linear, world coordinate system (WCS)
information in the form of tables or images. The extension HDUs MAY
also contain other, non-standard metadata pertaining to the image in
the PHDU in the forms of keywords and tables.

A FITS file described with the media type "image/fits" SHOULD be
principally intended to communicate the single data array in the
PHDU. This means that "image/fits" SHOULD NOT be applied to FITS
files containing MEF (multi-exposure-frame) mosaic images. Also,
random groups files MUST be described as "application/fits" and not
as "image/fits".

A FITS file described with the media type "image/fits" is also valid
as a file of media type "application/fits". The choice of
classification depends on the context and intended usage.

Recommendations for application writers:

An application that is intended to handle "image/fits" SHOULD be able
to provide a user with a manifest of all of the HDUs that are present
in the file and with all of the keyword/value pairs from each of the
HDUs. An application writer MAY choose to ignore HDUs beyond the
PHDU, but even in this case the application SHOULD be able to present
the user with the keyword/value pairs from the PHDU.

Note that an application intended to render "image/fits" for viewing
by a user has significantly more responsibility than an application
intended to handle, e.g., "image/tiff" or "image/gif". FITS data
arrays contain elements which typically represent the values of a
physical quantity at some coordinate location. Consequently they
need not contain any pixel rendering information in the form of
transfer functions, and there is no mechanism for color look-up
tables. An application SHOULD provide this functionality, either
statically using a more or less sophisticated algorithm, or
interactively allowing a user various degrees of choice.

Furthermore, the elements in a FITS data array may be integers or
floating-point numbers. The dynamic range of the data array values
may exceed that of the display medium and the eye, and their
distribution may be highly nonuniform. Logarithmic, square-root, and
quadratic transfer functions along with histogram equalization
techniques have proved helpful for rendering FITS data arrays. Some
elements of the array may have values which indicate that their data
are undefined or invalid; these should be rendered distinctly. Via
WCS Paper I [WCS1] the standard permits "CTYPEnnn = 'COMPLEX'" to
assert that a data array contains complex numbers (future revisions
might admit other elements such as quaternions or general tensors).

Three-dimensional data arrays (NAXIS=3 with NAXIS1, NAXIS2 and NAXIS3
> 1) are of special interest. Applications intended to handle
"image/fits" MAY default to displaying the first 2D plane of such an
image cube, or they MAY default to presenting such an image in a
fashion akin to that used for an animated GIF, or they MAY present
the data cube as a mosaic of "thumbnail" images. Even in the absence
of WCS indication of a temporal axis the time-lapse movie-looping
display technique can be effective, and application writers SHOULD
consider offering it for all three-dimensional arrays.

An "image/fits" PHDU with NAXIS=1 is describing a one-dimensional
entity such as a spectrum or a time series. Applications intended to
handle "image/fits" MAY default to displaying such an image as a
graphical plot rather than as a two-dimensional picture with a single
row.

An application that cannot handle an image with dimensionality other
than 2 SHOULD gracefully indicate its limitations to its users when
it encounters NAXIS=1 or NAXIS=3 cases, while still providing access
to the keyword/value pairs.

FITS files with degenerate axes (i.e., one or more NAXISn=1) MAY be
described as "image/fits", but the first axes SHOULD be non-
degenerate (i.e., the degenerate axes SHOULD be the highest
dimensions). An algorithm designed to render only two-dimensional
images will be capable of displaying such an NAXIS=3 or NAXIS=4 FITS
array that has one or two of the axes consisting of a single pixel,
and an application writer SHOULD consider coding this capability into
the application. Writers of new applications which generate FITS
files intended to be described as "image/fits" SHOULD consider using
the WCSAXES keyword [WCS1] to declare the dimensionality of such
degenerate axes, so that NAXIS can be used to convey the number of
non-degenerate axes.

Magic number(s): "SIMPLE = T"

Jeff Uphoff of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) has
contributed database entries for the magic number file which is used
by the Unix "file" command. Magic number files with these entries
are distributed with a variety of Unix-like operating systems. In
addition to recognizing a FITS file using the string given above, the
Uphoff entries also recognize the data type of the pixels in the
PHDU.

File extension(s): fits

This file extension SHOULD NOT be interpreted as a prescription.

The FITS standard originated in the era when files were stored and
exchanged via magnetic tape; it does not prescribe any nomenclature
for files on disk. Various sites within the FITS community have
long-established practices where files are presumed to be FITS by
context. File extensions used at such sites commonly indicate
content of the file instead of the data format.

In the absence of other information it is reasonably safe to presume
that a file name ending in ".fits" is intended to be a FITS file.
Nevertheless, there are other commonly used extensions; e.g., ".fit",
".fts", and many others not suitable for listing in a media type
registration.
