Required parameters : NONE

Encoding considerations : binary


Security considerations :
Raster data can be very large, which could fill a filesystem and cause a
denial of service or system failure. Raster data contains no executables
or macros. Authentication and access control are normally handled by the
Internet Printing Protocol and Hyper-Text Transport Protocol.

This media type does not employ any sort of active or executable content.
Neither privacy nor integrity protection is provided by the media type
itself; if these protections are needed they must be implemented
externally.
