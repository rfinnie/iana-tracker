Security considerations: See section 4 of RFC 4337 and section 7 of

   protection and so they are applied externally when needed. The 
   security considerations of URLs are discussed in RFC 3986.

Interoperability considerations: The AVIF specification is based on a 
   set of specifications (AV1, ISOBMFF, HEIF, MIAF) and builds upon 
   their interoperability considerations. Further more, AVIF defines 
   specific constraints and signals them with specific code points to 
   improve interoperability between readers and writers of AV1 
   content.
