Media type name: image

Media subtype name: jxrS

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: Same as for the media type image/heif.

   For JPEG XR coded image sequences, the codecs parameter contains 
   one or both of the 'mjxr' or 'mjxs' sample entry types, and the 
   first value of the codecs parameter should represent a track 
   having the handler type 'pict'; other list items represent other 
   tracks.

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: See media type image/heif. In addition, 
   sample entries of type 'mjxr' and 'mjxs' contain structures of 
   variable length and have an extensible syntax. Both aspects 
   present potential security risks for implementations. In 
   particular, variable length structures present buffer overflow 
   risks and extensible syntax could result in the triggering of 
   adverse actions.

Interoperability considerations: JPEG XR coded images can conform to 
   one of several profiles and levels of capabilities (as specified 
   in Annex B of Rec. ITU-T T.832 | ISO/IEC 29199-2) â€“ not all of 
   which may be supported by a receiving decoder. As a result, 
   implementations may attempt to decode and display an encoded JPEG 
   XR image only to determine that the image cannot be rendered 
   either partially or in full.

Published specification: Rec. ITU-T T.832 | ISO/IEC 29199-2
