Media type name: image

Media subtype name: jxss

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: Same as for the media type image/heif. The 
   presence of a sample entry of type 'jxsm' is signalled by 
   including a value whose first element is 'jxsm' in the codecs 
   parameter. 

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: See Media type image/heif. In addition, 
   sample entries of type 'jxsm' contain structures of variable 
   length and have an extensible syntax. Both aspects present 
   potential security risks for implementations. In particular, 
   variable length structures present buffer overflow risks and 
   extensible syntax could result in the triggering of adverse 
   actions.

Interoperability considerations: Same as for the Media type 
   image/heif. In addition, sample entries of type 'jxsm' can conform
   to one of several profiles and/or require one of several 
   capabilities, e.g. as specified in ISO/IEC 21122-2 – not all of 
   which are necessarily supported by a receiving decoder. As a   
   result, decoders might attempt to process the contents only to 
   determine that they cannot be rendered either partially or in 
   full.

Published specification: ISO/IEC 21122-3, Information technology – 
   JPEG XS low-latency lightweight image coding system - Part 3: 
   Transport and container formats 

Applications: Multimedia, Imaging, Pictures, Scientific

Fragment identifier considerations: same as for Media type image/heif

Restrictions on usage: None

   Depreciated alias names: N/A
   Magic number(s): None
   File extension(s): jxss
   Macintosh File Type Code(s): N/A
   Object Identifiers: N/A
