Type name: image

Subtype name: jphc

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: HTJ2K codestreams contain structures of 
   variable length and have an extensible syntax. Both of these 
   aspects present potential security risks for implementations. In 
   particular, variable length structures present buffer overflow 
   risks and extensible syntax could result in the triggering of 
   adverse actions.

Interoperability considerations: HTJ2K codestreams do not contain 
   information on the colourspace of the image. This information is 
   implied or provided out-of-band.
