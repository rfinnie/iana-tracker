Compound Image Registration

   The image/jpm content-type refers to all of the profiles and
   extensions that build on JPEG 2000 [ISO-JPEG2000-1] encoded image
   data. The file format is also defined in [ISO-JPEG2000-6]. The
   recommended file suffix is "jpm"

MIME media type name:              image
MIME subtype name:                 jpm
Required parameters:               none
Optional parameters:               none
                                   It is up to the implementation to
                                   determine the application (if
                                   necessary) and render the image to
                                   the user.
Encoding considerations:           files are binary and should be
                                   transmitted in a suitable encoding
                                   without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                   stripping etc.; base64 is a suitable
                                   encoding;
Security considerations:           see [RFC3745]
Interoperability considerations:   A number of interoperating
                                   implementations are under development
                                   within the JPEG 2000 community.
