The image/g3fax content-type

This content-type is defined to carry G3 Facsimile byte streams.

In general, a G3Fax image contains 3 pieces of information:

    (1)  A set of flags indicating the particular coding
         scheme.  CCITT Recommendation T.30 defines how the
         flags are transmitted over telephones. In this
         medium, the flags are carried as parameters in the
         MIME content-type header field.

    (2)  A structure that divides the bits into pages.  CCITT
         recommendation T.30 describes how to define page
         boundaries.  A page break algorithm is defined here
         that is independent of how the image data is
         conveyed.

    (3)  For each page, a sequence of bits that form the
         encoding of the image.  CCITT recommendation T.4
         defines the bit image format.  This is used without
         change.
