MIME media type name: image

MIME subtype name: avci

   This MIME type may be used when the requirements of the 'avci' 
   brand specified in section E.4.1 of ISO/IEC 23008-12 apply 
   (notably when the primary image satisfies the requirements of 
   E.4.1.1). (A brand in the file header identifies a specific 
   profile of a more general format.)

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:

   profiles: Specified by RFC 6381 and its successors.

   codecs: Specified by RFC 6381 and its successors for files 
      conforming to specifications derived from ISO/IEC 14496-12. 
      Note that for AVC, the format of a list item included in the 
      value of the codecs parameter is specified in ISO/IEC 14496-15.

   itemtypes: As for the MIME type image/heic

      When the item type is a four-character code of a coded image, 
      it may be followed by a dot-separated ('.') value, as specified 
      for the codecs parameter of the ISO base media file format name 
      space in RFC 6381. For the item type 'avc1', the value after 
      the '.' is the 'avcoti' value as specified in ISO/IEC 14496-15.

Encoding considerations: as for video/mp4

Security considerations: See section 4 of RFC 4337 and section 7 of 
   RFC 6381. This format does not supply integrity or confidentiality 
   protection and so they are applied externally when needed.

Interoperability considerations: Interoperably deployed in reference 
   code available from ISO, Javascript code from Nokia labs, in 
   open-source in MP4Box and various other implementations.
