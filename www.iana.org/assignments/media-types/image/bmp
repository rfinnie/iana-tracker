Type name: image

Subtype name: bmp

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters: None.

Encoding considerations: Binary.

Security considerations:

   Bitmaps have a mostly unremarkable security history.

   Because BMP data can encapsulate JPEG or PNG data (BI_JPEG, BI_PNG
   values of the Compression enumeration in Section 2.1.1.7 of the
   WMF specification), the security considerations of JPEG and PNG
   processing may also apply to BMP.

   As a "basic" image format, the image/bmp media type does not
   employ executable content and provides no facilities for privacy
   or integrity.

Interoperability considerations:

   Uncompressed Windows Bitmaps can be rather large.  If there is a
   need to compress an image, modern applications should consider
   emitting JPEG or PNG data instead of embedding them in BMP
   payloads.

Published specification:

Applications that use this media type:

   Office productivity applications; clip art applications; desktop
   publishing applications; web browsers; graphics processing
   applications.

Fragment identifier considerations: None.

Additional information:

   Magic number(s):
      42 4D ("BM"), meaning "bitmap".  The next field
      (BITMAPFILEHEADER bfSize) is a little-endian DWORD indicating
      the size of the bitmap content in bytes.

   File extension(s): .bmp, .dib

   Macintosh file type code(s):
      "BMP ", "BMPf", or "BMPp".  Apple has promulgated a uniform
      type identifier (UTI) of "com.microsoft.bmp".
