(registered by RFC-seantek-windows-image-03)

Type name: image

Subtype name: bmp

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters: None.

Encoding considerations: Binary.

Security considerations:

 Bitmaps have a mostly unremarkable security history.

 Because BMP data can encapsulate JPEG or PNG data (BI_JPEG, BI_PNG
 values of the Compression enumeration in Section 2.1.1.7 of the WMF
 specification), the security considerations of JPEG and PNG
 processing may also apply to BMP.

Interoperability considerations:

 Uncompressed Windows Bitmaps can be rather large. If there is a
 need to compress an image, modern applications SHOULD consider
 emitting JPEG or PNG data instead of embedding them in BMP
 payloads.
