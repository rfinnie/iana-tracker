Media type name: image

Media subtype name: jxsc

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary
   Codestreams are binary and should be transmitted in a suitable 
   encoding without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping etc.; base64 is
   a suitable encoding.

Security considerations: JPEG XS codestreams contain structures of 
   variable length and have an extensible syntax. Both of these 
   aspects present potential security risks for implementations. In 
   particular, variable length structures present buffer overflow 
   risks and extensible syntax could result in the triggering of 
   adverse actions.

Interoperability considerations: The JPEG XS codestream does not 
   contain information on the colourspace of the image. This 
   information is implied or provided out-of-band. JPEG XS 
   codestreams can conform to one of several profiles and levels of 
   capabilities (as specified in ISO/IEC 21122-2) – not all of which 
   may be supported by a receiving decoder. As a result, 
   implementations may attempt to decode and display an encoded JPEG 
   XS codestream only to determine that the image cannot be rendered 
   either partially or in full.

Published specifications:
   ISO/IEC 21122-3, Information technology – JPEG XS low-latency 
   lightweight image coding system - Part 3: Transport and container 
   formats
