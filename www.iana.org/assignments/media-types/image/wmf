(registered by RFC-seantek-windows-image-03)

Type name: image

Subtype name: wmf

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters:

DEFAULT_CHARSET: The character set intended when the CharacterSet
 Enumeration (see the WMF specification) specifies DEFAULT_CHARSET.
 The value of this parameter is a charset name defined in accordance
 to the procedures laid out in RFC 2978. When this parameter is not
 specified, DEFAULT_CHARSET has the following meaning in the WMF
 specification: "a character set based on the current system locale;
 for example, when the system locale is United States English, the
 default character set is ANSI_CHARSET" (which is Windows-1252,
 more-or-less). I.e., when not specified, the default character set
 is system-dependent. As this optional parameter is novel, EMF
 instead of WMF (or if necessary under the circumstances, embedded
 EMF within WMF) is a more sensible choice when text is present.

Encoding considerations: Binary.

Security considerations:

 The Windows Metafile format's security history is punctuated in
 2005-2006 with the disclosure of the Metafile Image Code Execution
 vulnerability, codenamed MICE. MICE won the 2007 Pwnie Award for
 "Mass 0wnage" and "Breaking the Internet". The official Microsoft
 security bulletin describes that the flaw occurs because Windows
 Metafiles can set the SETABORTPROC value of the MetafileEscapes
 enumeration (accessible via the META_ESCAPE record), allowing for
 arbitrary code execution, i.e., "active content".

 Windows Metafiles can contain Enhanced Metafiles using the
 META_ESCAPE_ENHANCED_METAFILE record; thus, the security
 considerations of EMF apply to WMF.

 Windows Metafiles are historically very buggy. As the original
 intent was to replicate Windows GDI calls, flaws in GDI, or in a
 display or printer driver implementing the back-end to GDI, could
 be exploitable. WMF implementations not backed by Windows GDI have
 different risks: namely, while a malicious WMF author may not
 consider the non-Windows GDI implementation as a primary target,
 WMF has many "corner case" records for which an implementation's
 processing may not have received the same level of scrutiny as the
 Windows implementation. "Fuzzing" the implementation is
 appropriate.

Interoperability considerations:

 Windows Metafile is the original 16-bit metafile format; it was
 released in 1990 at what some computer historians might consider
 the "zenith" of the desktop publishing revolution. Accordingly,
 there is a large body of free and commercially available clip art
 that is still in use, either independently or embedded in
 productivity documents (word processing documents, desktop
 publishing documents, slideshows and presentations, and
 spreadsheets and workbooks). For example, references to WMF content
 appear (non-normatively) in Office Open XML. To say that support
 for this format is necessary for interoperability would not be an
 understatement.

 Accommodations for comments or arbitrary data storage in Windows
 Metafiles are virtually non-existent. However, Windows Metafiles
 can contain Enhanced Metafiles using the
 META_ESCAPE_ENHANCED_METAFILE record, so an implementation that
 handles Windows Metafiles is also expected to handle enhanced
 metafile content. Windows Metafiles can store and output text
 strings (see META_TEXTOUT and META_EXTTEXTOUT records), but the
 encodings of the strings may be ambiguous. Unicode encodings are
 not possible without the DEFAULT_CHARSET parameter defined in this
 registration.

 The previously unregistered type "image/x-wmf" is also in wide use.
 Accordingly, it is registered as a deprecated alias. See Appendix A
 and Section 4.2.9 of [RFC6838].
