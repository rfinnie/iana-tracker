Subject: Registration of MIME type: image/naplps


MIME type name: image

MIME subtype name: naplps
	Content-Type of "image/naplps" indicates a graphic in
	NAPLPS format. NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer
	Protocol Syntax) is used to transmit device-independent
	vector and raster graphics. Due to their spatial and
	color coordinate schemes, these graphics, sometimes
	referred to as "frames", are executable by virtually any
	device.

Required parameters: version identification

	For example:

			image/naplps; version=1983

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations:
	As NAPLPS is based on an extensible "character set"
	scheme which includes completely interchangeable 7-bit
	and 8-bit options, NAPLPS graphics may contain data in
	either 7-bit or 8-bit format. In order to avoid the need
	for encoding and decoding, 7-bit NAPLPS character sets
	are recommended for all 7-bit environments.

Security considerations: None.

Published specification:
	Documents describing NAPLPS (North American Presentation
	Layer Protocol Syntax):
		ANSI X3.110-1983
		CSA T500-1983
