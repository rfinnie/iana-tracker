Still Image Registration

   The image/jp2 content-type refers to all of the profiles and
   extensions that build on JPEG 2000 [ISO-JPEG2000-1] encoded image
   data. The file format is also defined in [ISO-JPEG2000-1], Annex I.
   The recommended file suffix is "jp2"

   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/jp2

MIME media type name:              image
MIME subtype name:                 jp2
Required parameters:               none
Optional parameters:               none
                                   It is up to the implementation to
                                   determine the application (if
                                   necessary) and render the image to
                                   the user.
Encoding considerations:           files are binary and should be
                                   transmitted in a suitable encoding
                                   without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                   stripping etc.; base64 is a suitable
                                   encoding;
Security considerations:           see [RFC3745]
Interoperability considerations:   The ability of implementations to
                                   handle all the defined applications
                                   (or profiles within applications) of
                                   JPEG 2000 may not be ubiquitous. As a
                                   result, implementations may decode
                                   and attempt to display the encoded
                                   JPEG 2000 image data only to
                                   determine that the image cannot be
                                   rendered either partially or in full.
Published specification:           ISO/IEC 15444-1 defines the JPEG 2000
                                   codec and the jp2 file format
Applications which use this media type: Imaging, fax, messaging and
                                   multi-media
