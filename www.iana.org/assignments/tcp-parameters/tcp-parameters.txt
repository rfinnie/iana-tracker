TCP Option Kind Numbers

   Registration Procedure(s)

 IESG Approval or Standards Action

   Reference
           [RFC2780]

   Note

 The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has provision for optional
 header fields identified by an option kind field.  Options 0 and 1 are
 exactly one octet which is their kind field.  All other options have
 their one octet kind field, followed by a one octet length field,
 followed by length-2 octets of option data.

 [*] It is only appropriate to use these values in explicitly-
     configured experiments; they MUST NOT be shipped as defaults in
     implementations.  See [RFC3692] for details.

 [**] These values have been deployed in the Internet without proper
     IANA assignment. At some point, these numbers may be officially
     allocated for some new purpose. It is therefore strongly recommended
     that implementers migrate to mechanisms with IANA-assigned values to
     avoid potential issues with their systems or products at a later point.

 [***] This value has been deployed on the Internet in ways that are
     not compatible with the documented use in this IANA allocation.
