    <note>Sometimes a host is not known to the domain name system and
communication (and, in particular, communication to report and repair
the error) is blocked.  To bypass this barrier a special literal form
of the address is allowed as an alternative to a domain name.  For
IPv4 addresses, this form uses four small decimal integers separated
by dots and enclosed by brackets such as <xref type="text">123.255.37.2</xref>, which
indicates an (IPv4) Internet Address in sequence-of-octets form.  For
IPv6 and other forms of addressing that might eventually be
standardized, the form consists of a standardized "tag" that
identifies the address syntax, a colon, and the address itself, in a
format specified as part of the IPv6 standards <xref type="text">17</xref>.</note>
