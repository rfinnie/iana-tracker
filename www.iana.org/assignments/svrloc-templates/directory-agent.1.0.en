# Security Considerations:   
#   Authentication of Directory Agent URLs is possible within the context
#   of SLPv2 [RFC2608].  Directory Agent URLs may be used by SLPv2 UAs and 
#   SAs.  If SLPv2 security mechanisms are not used, UAs and SAs will have 
#   no guarantee these services actually conform to the selected subset.

  template-description=
    This defines the directory-agent service type.  This service is
    used by SLPv2 User Agents, who issue service discovery requests
    and by SLPv2 Service Agents, who register their services with
    the Directory Agent.  The SLPv2 Directory Agent caches the service
    information and provides scalability to the SLPv2 protocol.  The
    Directory Agent MAY include attribute information in its DAAdvert
    messages.  User Agents and Service Agents MAY also use attributes
    to select Directory Agents, by issuing SLPv2 Directory Agent
    discovery Service Requests messages which include a search filter.

    url-path= ; The URL of the service agent.  Defined in RFC 2608.

  min-refresh-interval=string L O
  ; The minimum lifetime the Directory Agent will accept in service
  ; registrations.
