# Security Considerations:
#   Authentication of Service Agent URLs is possible within the context
#   of SLPv2 [RFC2608].  Service Agent URLs may be used by SLPv2 UAs.  
#   The use of the service information included in this template allows 
#   UAs to select a subset of all SLPv2 SAs.  If SLPv2 security mechanisms
#   are not used, the UAs will have no guarantee these services actually
#   conform to the selected subset.

  template-description=
    This defines the service-agent service type.  This service is
    used by SLPv2 User Agents to do service discovery in the absense
    of SLPv2 Directory Agents.  By discovering all SLPv2 Service
    Agents, the User Agents know both their locations (so they may
    send unicast requests to them) and the scopes they support.
    Service Agent discovery and the use of service:service-agent
    URLs is defined in RFC 2608.

  template-url-syntax=
    url-path= ; The URL of the service agent.  Defined in RFC 2608.

  service-type=string M L
  ; The service types advertised by the Service Agent.
