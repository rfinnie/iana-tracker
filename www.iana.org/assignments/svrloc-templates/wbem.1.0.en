# Security Considerations:
#    Information about the specific WBEM Server implementation or the
#    Operating System platform may be deemed a security risk in certain
#    environments. Therefore these attributes are optional but
#    recommended. For example, exposing the authentication mechanisms
#    exposes a vulnerability unless SLP is autheticated.

# Terminology
# The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
# "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
# this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
#
# Value Format/Definition
# For each description below that states the value MUST be 
# the CIM_ClassName.PropertyName value. The format/rules for these 
# values are defined in the Interop Model of the CIM Schema. For 
# example, for CIM Schema 2.8, see the file CIM_Interop28.mof.
# This SLP Template requires a minimum Schema version of 2.7 
# to support the required values. Some of the optional values
# require CIM Schema version 2.8
# The CIM Schema can be found at http://dmtf.org/ on the CIM Standards
# page.

template-type=wbem

template-version=1.0

template-description=
    This template describes the attributes used for advertising
    WBEM Servers.

template-url-syntax=string
#The template-url-syntax MUST be the WBEM URI Mapping of
#the location of one service access point offered by the WBEM Server 
#over TCP transport. This attribute must provide sufficient addressing 
#information so that the WBEM Server can be addressed directly using 
#the URL.  The WBEM URI Mapping is defined in the WBEM URI Mapping 
#Specification 1.0.0 (DSP0207).
# Example: (template-url-syntax=https://localhost:5989)

service-hi-name=string O
# This string is used as a name of the CIM service for human
# interfaces. This attribute MUST be the
# CIM_ObjectManager.ElementName property value.

service-hi-description=string O
# This string is used as a description of the CIM service for
# human interfaces.This attribute MUST be the 
# CIM_ObjectManager.Description property value.

service-id=string L
# The ID of this WBEM Server. The value MUST be the 
# CIM_ObjectManager.Name property value.

CommunicationMechanism=string L
# The communication mechanism (protocol) used by the CIM Object Manager for
# this service-location-tcp defined in this advertisement. This information 
# MUST be the CIM_ObjectManagerCommunicationMechanism.CommunicationMechanism
# property value.
# CIM-XML is defined in the CIM Operations over HTTP specification which can 
# be found at http://dmtf.org/
"Unknown", "Other", "cim-xml"

OtherCommunicationMechanismDescription = String L O
# The other communication mechanism defined for the CIM Server in the case
# the "Other" value is set in the CommunicationMechanism string.
# This attribute MUST be the CIM_ObjectManagerCommunicationMechanism.OtherCommunicationMechanism
# property value. This attribute is optional because it is only required if the
# "other" value is set in CommunicationMechansim. The value returned is
# a free-form string.

InteropSchemaNamespace=string L M
# Namespace within the target WBEM Server where the CIM Interop Schema can be
# accessed. Multiple namespaces may be provided. Each namespace provided
# MUST contain the same information.
 
ProtocolVersion=String O L
# The version of the protocol. It MUST be the
# CIM_ObjectManagerCommunicationMechanism.Version property value.

FunctionalProfilesSupported=string L M
# ProfilesSupported defines the CIM Operation profiles supported by the
# CIM Object Manager. This attribute MUST be the
# CIM_ObjectManagerCommunicationMechansim.FunctionalProfilesSupported 
# property value.

"Schema Manipulation", "Instance Manipulation",
"Association Traversal", "Query Execution",
"Qualifier Declaration", "Indications"

FunctionalProfileDescriptions=string L O M
# Other profile description if the "other" value is set in the ProfilesSupported
# attribute.  This attribute is optional because it is returned only if the "other"
# value is set in the ProfilesSupported attribute. If provided it MUST
# be equal to the CIM_ObjectManagerCommunicationMechanism.FunctionalProfileDescriptions
# property value.

MultipleOperationsSupported=Boolean
# Defines whether the CIM Object Manager supports batch operations.
# This attribute MUST be the 
# CIM_ObjectManagerCommunicationMechanism.MultipleOperationsSupported
# property value.

AuthenticationMechanismsSupported=String L M
# Defines the authentication mechanism supported by the CIM Object Manager.
# This attributed MUST be the
# CIM_ObjectManagerCommunicationMechanism.AuthenticationMechanismsSupported property value.
"Unknown", "None", "Other", "Basic", "Digest"
 
AuthenticationMechansimDescriptions=String L O M
# Defines other Authentication mechanisms supported by the CIM Object Manager
# in the case where the "Other" value is set in any of the
# AuthenticationMechanismSupported attribute values. If provided, this attribute MUST be the
# CIM_ObjectManagerCommunicationMechanism.AuthenticationMechansimDescriptions
# property value.

Namespace=string L M O
# Namespace(s) supported on the CIM Object Manager.
# This attribute MUST be the 
# CIM_Namespace.name property value for each instance of CIM_Namespace
# that exists. This attribute is optional.  
# NOTE: This value is literal (L) because
# the namespace names MUST not be translated into other languages.
 
Classinfo=string M O
# This attributes is optional but if used, the values MUST be the
# CIM_Namespace.Classinfo property value.
# The values represent the classinfo (CIM Schema version, etc.) for
# the namespaces defined in the corresponding namespace listed in the
# Namespace attribute. Each entry in this attribute MUST correspond
# to the namespace defined in the same position of the namespace
# attribute. There must be one entry in this attribute for each
# entry in the namespace attribute.


RegisteredProfilesSupported=string L M 
# RegisteredProfilesSupported defines the Profiles that 
# this WBEM Server has support for. Each entry in this 
# attribute MUST be in the form of 
# Organization:Profile Name{:Subprofile Name} 
#
# examples: 
#     DMTF:CIM Server 
#     DMTF:CIM Server:Protocol Adapter 
#     DMTF:CIM Server:Provider Registration 
# The Organization MUST be the 
# CIM_RegisteredProfile.RegisteredOrganization property value.
# The Profile Name MUST be the 
# CIM_RegisteredProfile.RegisteredName property value. 
# The subprofile Name MUST be the 
# CIM_RegisteredProfile.RegisteredName property value when it is 
# used as a Dependent in the CIM_SubProfileRequiresProfile
# association for the specified Profile Name (used as the antecedent).
