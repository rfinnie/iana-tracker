6. Any other relevant information:
Third Stage and Second Stage orthographies differ significantly in their use of diacritical marks.
The Second Stage spelling for Phaj Hauj Hmoob would be read in Third Stage orthography as Pham Haug Hmoob.
The Third Stage spelling for Phaj Hauj Hmoob would be read in Second Stage orthography as Phab HauX Hmoob, with no tone readable for the second syllable because the macron-shaped diacritic is not used with the letter KAUB in that orthography.
