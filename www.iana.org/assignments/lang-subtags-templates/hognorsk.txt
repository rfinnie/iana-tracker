LANGUAGE SUBTAG REGISTRATION FORM

1. Name of requester: Thorgeir Holm
2. E-mail address of requester: thorgeirholm (at) yahoo.no
3. Record Requested:

Type: variant
Subtag: hognorsk
Description: Norwegian in Høgnorsk (High Norwegian) orthography
Prefix: nn
Comments: Norwegian following Ivar Aasen's orthographical
principles, including modern usage.

4. Intended meaning of the subtag:

Høgnorsk (High Norwegian) orthography of Norwegian follows the
principles of Ivar Aasen's "Landsmaal" as put forth in his grammar
(1864) and dictionary (1873). Also known as "Aasen-mål" or "tradisjonell
nynorsk". The subtag is not primarily intended for historical texts, but
for modern use of this non-official orthography, in contrast to official
Norwegian Nynorsk (nn).

5. Reference to published description of the language (book or
article):

-- Aasen, Ivar: Norsk Grammatik (1864)
-- Aasen, Ivar: Norsk Ordbog (1873)
-- http://www.ivaraasen.no/wiki/index.php?title=Hovudsida
(wiki about (and in) the Høgnorsk language)

6. Any other relevant information:

Norwegian in Høgnorsk or Aasen-like orthography was official until
the Norwegian language reform of 1938. Its use has continued
non-officially, and today quite a few young people prefer this variety.
Recently, software applications are being localized according to this
orthography, and this use makes a separate variant subtag desireable.
