This registration corrects an error made on 2015-02-12 to the
registration of extended language subtag 'yds'. In deprecating the
subtag, the Preferred-Value was removed. According to RFC 5646, Section
2.2.2, item 3, "Extended language subtag records MUST include a
'Preferred-Value'. The 'Preferred-Value' and 'Subtag' fields MUST be
identical." This registration restores the Preferred-Value.
