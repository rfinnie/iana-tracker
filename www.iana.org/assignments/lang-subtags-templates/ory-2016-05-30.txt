2016-01-15, adding "Odia" as the reference name for 'ory' and retaining
"Oriya (individual language)" as an additional name. The note
"(individual language)" was added to "Odia" to distinguish this item
from the macrolanguage Odia ('or') at the Description level.

This name change does not affect the existing macrolanguage association
with Oriya ('or').
