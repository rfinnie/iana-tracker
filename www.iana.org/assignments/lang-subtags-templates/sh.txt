The ISO 639-3 code corresponding to 'sh' is not deprecated, it is an
ordinary macrolanguage like many ('no', 'zh', 'ar',...). The new version
of BCP 47 follows the status of languages in ISO 639-3, and for
consistency "sh" should not be deprecated.

(From a usage standpoint, the code "sh" is also as useful as any other
macrolanguage.)
