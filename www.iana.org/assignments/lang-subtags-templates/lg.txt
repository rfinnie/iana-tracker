The name "Luganda" is used widely to refer to the language called
"Ganda" in ISO 639-2 and 639-3, not only as an endonym but in English-
language contexts.

Ethnologue lists "Luganda" as the autonym and "Baganda, LùGáànda,
luGanda" as alternate names.

The English-language Wikipedia article on "Luganda" (renamed from "Ganda
language" in 2010) begins, "The Ganda language, or Luganda..." and then
refers to the language exclusively as "Luganda." Reference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luganda

A CLDR ticket has been written to rename Ganda to Luganda. Adding this
Description field in the Registry may facilitate the decision on whether
to do this in CLDR. Reference: http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11004
