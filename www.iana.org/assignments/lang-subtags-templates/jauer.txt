   6. Any other relevant information:

        The dialect of the Val Müstair does not have a standardised
written form. Even though the dialects of Romansh spoken there
exhibits some differences from the dialect of the Lower Engadine, it
was the Vallader written standard, derived from (sub)dialects of the
Lower Engadine, that was traditionally used in the Val Müstair, and
that was taught in schools there.

        Recently, the Rumantsch Grischun supraregional standard has
started to be used in schools in Val Müstair. They were among the
first school districts to make use of Rumantsch Grischun in their
instruction; perhaps because the inhabitants were already accustomed
to making use of a written standard that did not correspond as well to
their spoken dialects.

        The subtag "jauer" is perhaps most useful to represent spoken
Jauer, since Jauer is not often written. However, it may also
represent written Jauer (which typically uses an _ad hoc_ orthography:
every speaker writes as he thinks fit).

        Texts written by Jauer speakers in a written standard are
better tagged with the appropriate subtags, such as rm-vallader for
the Vallader standard traditionally used in the Val Müstair or
rm-rumgr for the Rumantsch Grischun supraregional written standard.
