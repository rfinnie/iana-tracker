5. Reference to published description
   of the language (book or article):

   UN M.49, a source standard for BCP 47.

6. Any other relevant information:

   This registration adds a Comments field to the existing region subtag
   021 for "Northern America," which was included in the original
   Language Subtag Registry in 2005, and whose meaning is unchanged by
   this registration.  Due to the addition of region subtag 003 for the
   similar-sounding name "North America," this comment is intended to
   help users distinguish between the two.  The definitions of "North
   America" and "Northern America" are taken from UN M.49.
