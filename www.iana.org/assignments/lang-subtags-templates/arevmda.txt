This registration corrects an error made on 2018-03-24 to the
registration of variant subtag 'arevmda'. In deprecating the subtag, a
Preferred-Value was created that consisted of the language subtag 'hyw'.
According to RFC 5646, Section 3.1.2, "For fields of type 'script',
'region', or 'variant', 'Preferred-Value' contains the subtag of the
same type that is preferred for forming the language tag." Thus a
variant subtag cannot have a language subtag as its Preferred-Value.
This registration removes the invalid Preferred-Value and adds a
Comments field to aid the user in selecting the correct tag.
