2018-07-16, changing the English short name for 'SZ' from "Swaziland" to
"Eswatini". The spelling "eSwatini", which follows Swati orthography and
is used in Swati-language contexts, is added as a secondary description.
The existing Description field "Swaziland" is also retained as a
secondary description.
