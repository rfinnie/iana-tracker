LANGUAGE SUBTAG REGISTRATION FORM

Type: language
Subtag: bn
Description: Bengali
Description: Bangla
Suppress-Script: Beng

4. Intended meaning of the subtag:

5. Reference to published description of the language (book or article):

6. Any other relevant information:

This registration adds the name "Bangla" to the existing primary
language subtag 'bn' as a secondary Description field. The existing name
"Bengali" is retained as the primary Description field.

The native (Bengali) name of both the Bengali language and script is
"Bangla," and the constitution of Bangladesh lists "Bangla" as the
official English-language name; however, the Eighth Schedule of the
constitution of India refers to the language as "Bengali." Because the
name "Bengali" continues to be widely used among non-Bengali speakers,
and has not been formally replaced in India, this registration
establishes "Bangla" as a secondary Description field while retaining
"Bengali" as the primary Description field.

ISO 639-3 lists "Bengali" as the sole name of the language. Ethnologue
lists the language under the heading "Bengali" but identifies "Bangala,
Bangla, Bangla-Bhasa" as alternate names. The name "Bangla" replaced
"Bengali" in CLDR for both the language (May 2016) and script (April
2016; see tickets 8632 and 9373).
