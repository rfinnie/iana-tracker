   4. Intended meaning of the subtag: 
     The South Jutish / South Jutlandic dialect, spoken in southern Denmark
     and northern Germany, particularly in the region of Schleswig which
     crosses current borders, has distinct pronunciation, orthography,
     and lexical items when compared to Danish or German. Also known as 
     Synnejysk, Sønderjysk, Südjütisch, or Plattdänisch.

   5. Reference to published description of the language (book or article):
      There is an established literature on the language; the Wikipedia
      page provides a good jumping-off point - 
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jutlandic
      A TV series from the national broadcaster giving instructions in the dialect:

   6. Any other relevant information:
      The subtag "synnejyl" is a shortened form of "synnejyll", an alternative
      name for the dialect. The 8-character truncation of synnejysk, "synnejys"
      is confusing and doesn't convey the intended meaning effectively.
