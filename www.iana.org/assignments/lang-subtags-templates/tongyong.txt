6. Any other relevant information: The Tongyong Pinyin transcription standard was official in Taiwan in the mid-2000s. It has now been displaced by Pinyin romanization as the official transcription rule for Chinese languages in Taiwan, however it is still continually being used to a certain extent within Taiwan and thus it would be helpful to have a variant subtag to separate it from Pinyin Romanization.
