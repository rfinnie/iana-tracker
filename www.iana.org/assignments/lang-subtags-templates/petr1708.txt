 5. Reference to published description
    of the language (book or article):

Грот, Яков Карлович «Русское правописание» (1885) [Grot, Iakov
Karlovich _Russian_Orthography_ (1885)]
Декрет Наркомпроса РСФСР от 23.12.1917 года «О введении нового
правописания», published in «Газета Временного Рабочего и
Крестьянского Правительства», № 40, 23.12.1917 [Decree of the People's
Commission for Enlightenment of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist
Republic on 23 December 1917 "On the introduction of the new
orthography", published in the "Newspaper of the Temporary Workers'
and Peasants' Government", No. 40, 23 December 1917]

 6. Any other relevant information:

The decree referenced above lays out the differences between the
orthography denoted by the present subtag and the modern (post-1917)
norm. The subtag does not distinguish between orthographic variants in
the intervening years. Iakov Grot's 1885 _Russian_Orthography_ provides
the first full description of the orthography and the established norm.
