To be used to indicate transcriptions in a system of romanization
approved by the Chinese government. The first such transcription, for
Mandarin Chinese, was adopted by the Chinese government in 1958 and by
the International Organization for Standardization in 1982. The
salient features of Pinyin as applied to Mandarin Chinese are the use
of <b p d t g k j q x zh ch sh> for [p pʰ t tʰ k kʰ tɕ tɕʰ ɕ
ʈʂ ʈʂʰ ʂ] respectively. The subtag zh-Latn-pinyin refers to the
Hanyu Pinyin romanization of Mandarin Chinese. The subtag bo-Latn-
pinyin refers to the Tibetan Pinyin romanization of Tibetan.
