This registration tracks a change made to ISO 639-3 effective
2020-01-23, retiring the code element 'kjf' for Khalaj as non-existent.
No Preferred-Value is indicated. The Description value "Khalaj" is
changed to "Khalaj [Indo-Iranian]" in order to avoid assigning 'klj',
for an unrelated language whose reference name was simultaneously
changed from "Turkic Khalaj" to "Khalaj", as the Preferred-Value for
this subtag in accordance with RFC 5646, Section 3.1.5, paragraph 5.
