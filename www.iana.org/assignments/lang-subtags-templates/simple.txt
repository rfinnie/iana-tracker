"Simplification of language" here refers to ways of controlling
expressions in a language to make reading or comprehension easier for
particular target audiences, such as children or adults with limited
education, second-language learners, or people with cognitive
disabilities. Simplification of language can also be used for other
purposes, such as providing source content that can be more easily
translated into multiple languages. Examples of ways in which
expressions are made simpler might include use of limited vocabulary,
or avoidance of certain grammatical constructions.

This subtag represents a generic simplification of a language. For a
given language, certain agencies or user communities may formulate rules
for how to simplify expressions; this subtag does not distinguish any
particular simplified language varieties. For many usage scenarios
involving simplified forms of language, this generic subtag may suffice.
Additional subtags may be registered to indicate specific varieties if
necessary.
