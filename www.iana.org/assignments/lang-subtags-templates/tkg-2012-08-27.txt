6. Any other relevant information:

   This registration tracks a change made to ISO 639-3 effective
   2012-02-06, adding a macrolanguage assignment of 'mg' (Malagasy) for
   the existing language subtag 'tkg' (Tesaka Malagasy). The ISO 639-3
   change corrects an oversight in the ISO 639-3 change of 2011-05-18,
   in which 'tkg' was identified as encompassed by Malagasy but a
   macrolanguage assignment was not made.

   For more information on the ISO 639-3 change of 2012, refer to
