        The Romansh language is pluricentric; there have traditionally
been five written standards, called "idioms", roughly representing the
major dialect groups. The "Rumantsch Grischun" standard was introduced
in 1982 as a supraregional written standard for the entire Romansh
language. It is the form used, for example, by the Swiss government as
well as by the canton of Graubünden in material aimed at all Romansh
speakers. Other organisations, such as town or county administrations
or schools, may also use this standard form.
