  and used from 1824 to 1839 mostly in Styria (in what is now Eastern
  Slovenia).

4. Intended meaning of the subtag:

The subtag marks texts written in Slovene using the historical Dajnko
alphabet, which is distinguished from the contemporary norm by new
letters.

5. Reference to published description of the language (book or article):

Stabej, Marko. Peter Dajnko in njegova Dajnčica. In (Janez Cvirn, ed.)
Slovenska Kronika XIX. stoletja. (2001). Print.

6. Any other relevant information:

The tag "sl-dajnko" is relevant as a possible value of the @xml:lang
attribute to be used by language technology applications for
transcribing and modernising such texts, e.g. for text search in
cultural heritage digital libraries. E.g. the National and University
Library of Slovenia has plans to digitise about 4,000 pages of books
written in the Dajnko alphabet.
