6. Any other relevant information:

The Kirshenbaum phonetic alphabet was commonly used in Usenet until the
mid-1990s. In the meantime, IPA [fonipa] and X-Sampa [fonxsamp] have
become more popular as transcription systems; but thereâ€™s still
occasional use of the Kirschenbaum notation. For example, the
application programming interface of the espeak open-source
text-to-speech synthesis system accepts phonemic input in Kirshenbaum
transcription. The project will likely modernize its API at some point;
but in order to not break old clients, the software will need some
identifier for the phonetic alphabet.
