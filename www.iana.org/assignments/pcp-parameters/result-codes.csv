        header is not recognized by this PCP server.  This is a long

2,NOT_AUTHORIZED,"The requested operation is disabled for this PCP
        client, or the PCP client requested an operation that cannot be
        fulfilled by the PCP server's security policy.  This is a long
        lifetime error.",[RFC6887]

8,NO_RESOURCES,"Request is well-formed and valid, but the server has
        insufficient resources to complete the requested operation at this
        time.  For example, the NAT device cannot create more mappings at
        this time, is short of CPU cycles or memory, or is unable to
        handle the request due to some other temporary condition.  The
        same request may succeed in the future.  This is a system-wide
        error, different from USER_EX_QUOTA.  This can be used as a catch-
        all error, should no other error message be suitable.  This is a
        short lifetime error.",[RFC6887]

        external address cannot be provided.  This error MUST only be
        returned for:
        *  MAP requests that included the PREFER_FAILURE Option
        (normal MAP requests will return an available external port); 
        *  MAP requests for the SCTP protocol (PREFER_FAILURE is implied); 
        *  PEER requests.

12,ADDRESS_MISMATCH,"The source IP address of the request packet does
        not match the contents of the PCP Client's IP Address field, due
        to an unexpected NAT on the path between the PCP client and the
        PCP-controlled NAT or firewall.  This is a long lifetime error.",[RFC6887]
13,EXCESSIVE_REMOTE_PEERS,"The PCP server was not able to create the
        filters in this request.  This result code MUST only be returned
        if the MAP request contained the FILTER Option.  See Section 13.3
