                                        [RFC6887] describes PCP version 2.
                                        The requested operation is disabled for this PCP client, or the PCP
   2       NOT_AUTHORIZED               client requested an operation that cannot be fulfilled by the PCP   [RFC6887]
                                        server's security policy. This is a long lifetime error.
   3       MALFORMED_REQUEST            The request could not be successfully parsed. This is a long        [RFC6887]
                                        lifetime error.
   4       UNSUPP_OPCODE                Unsupported Opcode. This is a long lifetime error.                  [RFC6887]
   5       UNSUPP_OPTION                Unsupported Option. This error only occurs if the Option is in the  [RFC6887]
                                        mandatory-to-process range. This is a long lifetime error.
   6       MALFORMED_OPTION             Malformed Option (e.g., appears too many times, invalid length).    [RFC6887]
                                        This is a long lifetime error.
                                        The PCP server or the device it controls are experiencing a network
   7       NETWORK_FAILURE              failure of some sort (e.g., has not obtained an External IP         [RFC6887]
                                        address). This is a short lifetime error.
                                        Request is well-formed and valid, but the server has insufficient
                                        resources to complete the requested operation at this time. For
                                        example, the NAT device cannot create more mappings at this time,
   8       NO_RESOURCES                 is short of CPU cycles or memory, or is unable to handle the        [RFC6887]
                                        request due to some other temporary condition. The same request may
                                        succeed in the future. This is a system-wide error, different from
                                        USER_EX_QUOTA. This can be used as a catch- all error, should no
                                        other error message be suitable. This is a short lifetime error.
   9       UNSUPP_PROTOCOL              Unsupported transport protocol, e.g. SCTP in a NAT that handles     [RFC6887]
                                        only UDP and TCP. This is a long lifetime error.
   10      USER_EX_QUOTA                This attempt to create a new mapping would exceed this subscriber's [RFC6887]
                                        port quota. This is a short lifetime error.
                                        The suggested external port and/or external address cannot be
                                        provided. This error MUST only be returned for: * MAP requests that
                                        included the PREFER_FAILURE Option (normal MAP requests will return
   11      CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL      an available external port); * MAP requests for the SCTP protocol   [RFC6887]
                                        (PREFER_FAILURE is implied); * PEER requests. See Section 13.2 of
                                        [RFC6887] for processing details. The error lifetime depends on the
                                        reason for the failure.
                                        The source IP address of the request packet does not match the
   12      ADDRESS_MISMATCH             contents of the PCP Client's IP Address field, due to an unexpected [RFC6887]
                                        NAT on the path between the PCP client and the PCP-controlled NAT
                                        or firewall. This is a long lifetime error.
                                        The PCP server was not able to create the filters in this request.
   13      EXCESSIVE_REMOTE_PEERS       This result code MUST only be returned if the MAP request contained [RFC6887]
                                        the FILTER Option. See Section 13.3 for processing information.
                                        This is a long lifetime error.
   14      INITIATION                   The client includes this PCP result code in its request to the      [RFC7652]
                                        server for authentication.
   15      AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED      This error response is sent to the client if EAP authentication is  [RFC7652]
                                        required.
   16      AUTHENTICATION_FAILED        This error response is sent to the client if EAP authentication     [RFC7652]
                                        failed.
   17      AUTHENTICATION_SUCCEEDED     This success response is sent to the client if EAP authentication   [RFC7652]
                                        succeeded.
   18      AUTHORIZATION_FAILED         This error response is sent to the client if EAP authentication     [RFC7652]
                                        succeeded but authorization failed.
   19      SESSION_TERMINATED           This PCP result code indicates to the partner that the PA session   [RFC7652]
                                        must be terminated.
                                        This error response is sent from the PCP server if there is no
   20      UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID           known PA session associated with the Session ID sent in the PA      [RFC7652]
                                        request or common PCP request from the PCP client.
   21      DOWNGRADE_ATTACK_DETECTED    This PCP result code indicates to the client that the server        [RFC7652]
                                        detected a downgrade attack.
   22      AUTHENTICATION_REQUEST       The server indicates to the client that the PA message contains an  [RFC7652]
                                        EAP request.
   23      AUTHENTICATION_REPLY         The client indicates to the server that the PA message contains an  [RFC7652]
                                        EAP response.
                                        The provided identifier in a THIRD_PARTY_ID option is
   24      THIRD_PARTY_ID_UNKNOWN       unknown/unavailable to the PCP server. This is a long lifetime      [RFC-ietf-pcp-third-party-id-option-08]
                                        error.
                                        This error occurs if both THIRD_PARTY and THIRD_PARTY_ID options
   25      THIRD_PARTY_MISSING_OPTION   are expected in a request but one option is missing. This is a long [RFC-ietf-pcp-third-party-id-option-08]
                                        lifetime error.
   26      UNSUPP_THIRD_PARTY_ID_LENGTH The received option length is not supported. This is a long         [RFC-ietf-pcp-third-party-id-option-08]
                                        lifetime error.
