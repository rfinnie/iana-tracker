TSIG Algorithm Names

   Registration Procedure(s)

 IETF consensus policy

   Reference
           [RFC2845]

   Note

 TSIG Algorithm names are text strings encoded using the syntax
 of a domain name.  There is no structure required other
 than names for different algorithms must be unique when
 compared as DNS names, i.e., comparison is case insensitive.
 New algorithms are assigned using the IETF Consensus policy
 defined in RFC 2434.
