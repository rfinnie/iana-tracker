D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.

The purpose of this RRTYPE application is to allow EUI-48
and EUI-64 addresses to be stored in the DNS. EUI-48
addresses are those used, for example, in ethernet.

E. Description of the proposed RR type.

See RFC-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes-07 for a full
description.

F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that
need and why are they unsatisfactory?

The TXT record can be used to store arbitrary, unstructured
data in the DNS and hence could be used to store EUI-48 and
EUI-64 addresses. This approach is unsatisfactory for the
usual reasons, i.e. there is no opportunity for validating
data before it is stored, and typographical errors must
consequently be detected after data retrieval.

G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

EUI48 for EUI-48 addresses; EUI64 for EUI-64 addresses.

H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA
registry or require the creation of a new IANA sub-registry
in DNS Parameters? If so, please indicate which registry is
to be used or created. If a new sub-registry is needed, specify
the allocation policy for it and its initial contents. Also
include what the modification procedures will be.

No.

I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

No.

J. Comments:

See RFC-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes-07 for a complete
specification.
