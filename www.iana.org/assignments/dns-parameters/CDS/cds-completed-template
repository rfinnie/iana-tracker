   A.    Submission Date: 15 November 2010

   B.    Submission Type:
         [X] New RRTYPE
         [ ] Modification to existing RRTYPE

   D.    Motivation for the new RRTYPE application?

         To allow a copy of the DS RRset [RFC4034] to be published
         in the child zone, which is used to update the parent DS RRset.
         It is expected that this will allow the rollover of a key signing
         key to be automated.

   E.    Description of the proposed RR type.

         The format is identical to the DS record.
         However there is no special processing for servers/resolvers.

   F.    What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that
         need and why are they unsatisfactory?

         None.

   G.    What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

         CDS to stand for "Child DS".

   H.    Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA
         Registry or require the creation of a new IANA sub-registry in
         DNS Parameters?

         It uses the same registries as the DS record.

   I.    Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
         servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being
         processed as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

         No.

   J.    Comments:
         An RFC describing in detail how the CDS RRset may be used
         to update the parent DS RRset is anticipated. The current draft
         is draft-barwood-dnsop-ds-publish-01.
