   D.    Motivation for the new RRTYPE application?
         Support for the DANE WG document RFC8162.

   E.    Description of the proposed RR type.
         See RFC8162 for a complete description.

   F.    What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that
         need and why are they unsatisfactory?
         None.

   G.    What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?
         SMIMEA

   H.    Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA

         DNS Parameters?
         No.

   I.    Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
         servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being
         processed as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?
         No.
