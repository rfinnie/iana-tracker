B.1 Submission Type: [x] New RRTYPE [ ] Modification to RRTYPE
B.2 Kind of RR: [x] Data RR [ ] Meta-RR

D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.

Publishing RFC-4880 OpenPGP formatted keys in DNS with DNSSEC
protection to faciliate automatic encryption of emails in
defense against pervasive monitoring.

E. Description of the proposed RR type.

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey-00#section-2

F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that need
and why are they unsatisfactory?

The CERT RRtype is the closest match. It unfortunately depends on
subtyping, and its use in general is no longer recommended. It
also has no human usable presentation format. Some usage types of
CERT require external URI's which complicates the security model.
This was discussed in the dane working group.

G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

OPENPGPKEY

H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA registry
or require the creation of a new IANA subregistry in DNS
Parameters? If so, please indicate which registry is to be used
or created. If a new subregistry is needed, specify the
allocation policy for it and its initial contents. Also include
what the modification procedures will be.

The RDATA part uses the key format specified in RFC-4880, which
itself use 
https://www.iana.org/assignments/pgp-parameters/pgp-parameters.xhtm

This RRcode just uses the formats specified in those registries for its 
RRdata part.


I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

No.

J. Comments:

Currently, three software implementations of draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey
are using a private number.
