        [Richard_Stastny]","This Enumservice indicates that the person
           responsible for the NAPTR is accessible via the PSTN
           (Public Switched Telephone Network) or PLMN (Public
           Land Mobile Network) using the value of the
           generated URI.
         
        The kind of subsystem required to initiate a
           Voice Enumservice with this Subtype is a ""Dialler"".
           This is a subsystem that either provides a local
           connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that provides an
           indirect connection to those networks.  The
           subsystem will use the telephone number held in the
           generated URI to place a voice call.  The voice call
           is placed to a network that uses E.164 numbers to
           route calls to an appropriate destination.
         
        
           Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be
           indirect.  The end user receiving this NAPTR may
           have a relationship with a Communications Service
           Provider that accepts call initiation requests from
           that subsystem using an IP-based protocol such as
           SIP or H.323, and places the call to the PSTN using
           a remote gateway service.  In this case the Provider
           may either accept requests using ""tel:"" URIs or has
           a defined mechanism to convert ""tel:"" URI values
           into a ""protocol-native"" form.
         
        
           The ""tel:"" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified
           (using the ""global phone number"" form of RFC3966
           [10]).  A ""local phone number"" as defined in that
           document SHOULD NOT be used unless the controller of
           the zone in which the NAPTR appears is sure that it
           can be distinguished unambiguously by all clients
           that can access the resource record and that a call
           from their network access points can be routed to
           that destination.
