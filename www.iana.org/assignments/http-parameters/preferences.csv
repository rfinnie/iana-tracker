return,"One of either ""minimal"" or ""representation""","When the value is ""minimal"", it indicates that the
client prefers that the server return a minimal response to a
request. When the value is ""representation"", it indicates that
the client prefers that the server include a representation of the
current state of the resource in response to a request.","[RFC7240], Section 4.2"
wait,,"Indicates an upper bound to the length of time the
      client expects it will take the server to process the request once
      it has been received.","[RFC7240], Section 4.3"
handling,"One of either ""strict"" or ""lenient""","When value is ""strict"", it indicates that the client
wishes the server to apply strict validation and error handling to

depth-noroot,,"The ""depth-noroot"" preference indicates that the client 
        wishes for the server to exclude the target (root) resource from 
        processing by the HTTP method and only apply the HTTP method to the 
        target resource's subordinate resources. This preference is only 
        intended to be used with HTTP methods whose definitions explicitly 
        provide support for the Depth [RFC4918] 
        header field. Furthermore, this preference only applies when the 
        Depth header field has a value of ""1"" or ""infinity"" (either 
        implicitly or explicitly).","[RFC8144], Section 4"

odata.continue-on-error,,"Requests that the service attempt to continue processing a request that
        encounters non-fatal errors, for example in a multi-part request. The
        response SHOULD indicate what portions of the request were and were not
        able to be successfully handled.",[OData Version 4.01 Part 1: Protocol]
odata.include-annotations,"Comma-separated list of terms to include or, when prefixed with a minus
        sign (-), exclude from the response. Terms MUST be namespace-qualified and
