request. When the value is ""representation"", it indicates that
the client prefers that the server include a representation of the
current state of the resource in response to a request.","[RFC7240], Section 4.2"

      client expects it will take the server to process the request once
      it has been received.","[RFC7240], Section 4.3"

wishes the server to apply strict validation and error handling to

depth-noroot,,"The ""depth-noroot"" preference indicates that the client 
        wishes for the server to exclude the target (root) resource from 
        processing by the HTTP method and only apply the HTTP method to the 
        target resource's subordinate resources. This preference is only 
        intended to be used with HTTP methods whose definitions explicitly 
        provide support for the ""Depth"" [RFC4918] 
        header field. Furthermore, this preference only applies when the 
        ""Depth"" header field has a value of ""1"" or ""infinity"" (either 
        implicitly or explicitly).","[RFC-murchison-webdav-prefer-14], Section 4"
