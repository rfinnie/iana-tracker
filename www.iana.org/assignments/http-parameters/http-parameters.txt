                                                     When the value is "minimal", it indicates that the client prefers that
                 One of either "minimal" or          the server return a minimal response to a request. When the value is
   return        "representation"                    "representation", it indicates that the client prefers that the server  [RFC7240], Section 4.2

                                                     When value is "strict", it indicates that the client wishes the server
                                                     to apply strict validation and error handling to the processing of a

                                                     wishes the server to apply lenient validation and error handling to the

                                                     The "depth-noroot" preference indicates that the client wishes for the

   depth-noroot                                      subordinate resources. This preference is only intended to be used with [RFC8144], Section 4
