  <description>With the approval and publication of RFC6248, this module is
designated Obsolete.

The registry will no longer be updated, and the current contents will
be maintained as-is on the day that RFC6248 was published.

The original Description text follows below:

This module defines a registry for IP Performance Metrics.

Registrations are done sequentially by IANA in the ianaIppmMetrics
subtree on the bases of 'Specification Required' as defined in
<xref type="rfc" data="rfc2434"/>.

The reference of the specification must point to a stable document
including a title, a revision and a date.

The name always starts with the name of the organization and must
respect the SMIv2 rules for descriptors defined in the section 3.1
of <xref type="rfc" data="rfc2578"/>;

A document that creates new metrics would have an IANA
considerations section in which it would describe new metrics to
register.

An OBJECT IDENTITY assigned to a metric is definitive and cannot
be reused.  If a new version of a metric is produced then it is
assigned with a new name and a new identifier.
