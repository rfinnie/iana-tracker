Value,Message Description,Reference
0,No general error,
1,No control connection exists yet for this LAC-LNS pair,
2,Length is wrong,
3,"One of the field values was out of range or
reserved field was non-zero",
4,Insufficient resources to handle this operation now,
5,The Session ID is invalid in this context,
6,A generic vendor-specific error occurred in the LAC,
7,"Try another.  If LAC is aware of other possible LNS
destinations, it should try one of them.  This can be
used to guide an LAC based on LNS policy, for instance,
the existence of multilink PPP bundles.",
8,"Session or tunnel was shutdown due to receipt of an
unknown AVP with the M-bit set (see section 4.2). The Error
Message SHOULD contain the attribute of the offending AVP in
(human readable) text form.",
9,"Try another directed.  If an LAC or LNS is aware of other
possible destinations, it should inform the initiator of the
control connection or session.  The Error Message MUST contain
a comma-separated list of addresses from which the initiator
may choose.  If the L2TP data channel runs over IPv4, then
this would be a comma-separated list of IP addresses in the
canonical dotted-decimal format (e.g., ""192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.2,
192.0.2.3"") in the UTF-8 charset [RFC3629] using the Default
Language [RFC2277].  If there are no servers for the LAC or
LNS to suggest, then Error Code 7 should be used.  For IPv4,
the delimiter between addresses MUST be precisely a single
comma and a single space.  For IPv6, each literal address MUST
be enclosed in ""["" and ""]"" characters, following the encoding
described in [RFC2732].",
