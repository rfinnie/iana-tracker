  <description>This MIB module defines IANAgBondScheme and IANAgBondSchemeList
    TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs, specifying enumerated values of the
    gBondPortConfAdminScheme, gBondPortConfPeerAdminScheme,
    gBondPortStatOperScheme, gBondPortStatPeerOperScheme,
    gBondPortCapSchemesSupported, and gBondPortCapPeerSchemesSupported
    objects, respectively, as defined in the GBOND-MIB.
    
    It is intended that each new bonding scheme defined by the
    ITU-T Q4/SG15 working group and approved for publication in a
    revision of the ITU-T G.998 specification will be added to this
    MIB module, provided that it is suitable for being managed by the
    base objects in the GBOND-MIB.  An Expert Review, as defined in
    <xref type="rfc" data="rfc8126"/>, is REQUIRED for such additions.
    
    The following references are used throughout this MIB module:
    
    [G.998.1] refers to:
    ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1: 'ATM-based multi-pair bonding',
    January 2005.
    
    [G.998.2] refers to:
    ITU-T Recommendation G.998.2: 'Ethernet-based multi-pair
    bonding', January 2005.
    
    [G.998.3] refers to:
    ITU-T Recommendation G.998.3: 'Multi-pair bonding using
    time-division inverse multiplexing', January 2005.
    
    Naming Conventions:
    BCE   - Bonding Channel Entity
    GBS   - Generic Bonding Sub-layer
    
    These references should be updated as appropriate when a new
    bonding scheme is added to this MIB module.
