Registry Name: POP3 Response Codes
Reference: [RFC2449]
Registration Procedures: RFC Specification Required

Note: Please see section 9 of RFC2449 for details regarding Response Codes.

* - see spec for details

Note: Returning the AUTH response code to the USER command reveals
to the client that the specified user exists.  It is strongly
RECOMMENDED that the server not issue this response code to the
USER command.
