NamespaceID: urn-2

Registration Information:

  Version 1
  Date: 5Feb2001

Declared registrant of the namespace:

  Name: Robert M. Akscyn
  Email: rma&ks.com
  Affiliation: Knowledge Systems
  Address:  RR2 213A Evans Road, Export, PA 15632 USA

Declaration of syntactic structure:

  The identifier structure is as follows:

  URN: <assigned number>:<naming authority>:<name space string>

  where <naming authority> is a sequence of one or more <digit>
  and <hyphen>

  where <name space string> is a sequence of one or more <digit>,
  <alphabetic character>, <hyphen>, and <colon>

  where <digit> is from "0-9"

  where <alphabetic character> is from "a-z" or "A-Z"

  where <hyphen> is "-"

  where <colon> is ":"

Relevant ancillary documentation:

  RFC's: 1737, 2141, 2168, 2169, 2276, 2288, 2611, and  2434.

Identifier uniqueness considerations:

  URN identifiers are assigned uniquely -- they are assigned to at
  most one resource, and are not reassigned.

  Uniqueness is guaranteed as long as as individual URN is never
  reassigned.

  The namespace owner, or its delegated naming authorities will
  maintain a list of all assigned names and will consult that list
  before assigning any new names.

Identifier persistence considerations:

  Non-reassignment of URN identifiers ensures that a URN will
  persist in identifying a particular resource even after the
  "lifetime of the resource".

  The namespace owner will endeavor to ensure a quality of service
  that provides that the namespace is usable for the lifetime of
  the namespace owner. In the case of the namespace owners death or
  any change in the owners ability to ensure this level of service,
  the list of assigned names will be made publicly available so that
  archive services may continue to provide some level of service.

Process of identifier assignment:

  Assignment of a URN is a managed process.

  The process will be managed by Knowledge Systems,
  and its delegated naming authorities.

  URN assignment is completely closed.

  URNs are assigned by delegated naming authorities.

  URNs are not reassigned.

Process for identifier resolution:
 
  The namespace is not listed with an RDS.

Rules for Lexical Equivalence:
 
  The rules for lexical equivalence are that two names are
  lexically equivalent if they match character for character
  in a case sensitive manner with every character being significant.
  

Conformance with URN Syntax:  No special considerations.

Validation mechanism:  None specified.

Scope:  Global
