Namespace ID: urn-3

Registration Information:

  Version 2
  Date: 2009-01-27

Declared registrant of the namespace:

  Name:        Andrea Goethals
  E-mail:      nrs-ns-adm&hulmail.harvard.edu
  Affiliation: Harvard University Library
  Address:     Office for Information Systems
               90 Mt. Auburn Street
               Cambridge, MA 02138

  The named registrant is specified in her capacity as the namespace
  administrator for the Harvard University Library Office for
  Information Systems (HUL/OIS).  In the future, other individuals may
  be designated by HUL/OIS for the purposes of administering potential
  updates to this registration.

Declaration of syntactic structure:

  All URNs defined under the namespace have the following structure,
  specified in ABNF notation [1]:

    urn           = "urn:" nid ":" nss
    nid           = "urn-" n
    n             = number-assigned-by-IANA
    nss           = authoritypath ":" resourcename
    authoritypath = authority / (authoritypath "." authority)
    authority     = 1*authoritychar
    authoritychar = upper / lower / number /
                      "(" / ")" / "+" / "," / "-" / "=" / "@" /
                      ";" / "$" / "_" / "!" / "*" / "'" / ("%" hex hex)
    resourcename  = 1*resourcechar
    resourcechar  = authoritychar / "." / ":"

  where <upper>, <lower>, <number>, and <hex> are defined in Section
  2.2 of [4].

  The %-escaping mechanism, as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.1 of
  [4], is used to incorporate into URNs characters that are not
  explicitly allowed by the grammar.

  Examples of valid URNs defined under the namespace include:

    urn:urn-<n>:FHCL:10403
    urn:urn-<n>:HBS.Baker.TC:1923
    urn:urn-<n>:HUL.Eresource:holliswb
    urn:urn-<n>:HUL.OIS:Home

  The <authoritypath> component of the URN uniquely identifies the
  naming authority under which the URN was assigned.  A naming
  authority is an administrative unit or agent that has been granted
  the privilege of creating, and the responsibility for maintaining
  persistently, names in the subset of the full namespace identified
  by that authority's <authoritypath>.

  Naming authorities exist within a tree-like structure of authority
  delegation, under which any given naming authority derives its
  privileges and responsibilities from a pre-existing parent
  authority.  Naming authorities may independently propose and enforce
  local policies and administrative procedures relative to names
  created within their scope.

  The administrator of a naming authority, regardless of its position
  within the delegation tree, has full oversight and operational
  control over all aspects of URN administration of all delegated
  authorities that derive from the common parent.  The root naming
  authority for the namespace is administered by HUL/OIS.  The root
  authority exists solely to provide a common root of delegatable
  naming authority; it alone has no corresponding <authoritypath>.

Identifier uniqueness considerations:

  Individual naming authorities are responsible for insuring the
  uniqueness of the <resourcename> components of the URNs created
  within their scope.  Naming authorities are also responsible for
  insuring the uniqueness of the terminal <authority> component of the
  <authoritypath> for all delegated authorities.

Identifier persistence considerations:

  HUL provides an administrative system that maintains URN
  registration within the namespace.  The system insures that once a
  URN is assigned it is never reassigned to a different resource.

Process of identifier assignment:

  The administrative system is decentralized to allow individual
  naming authorities to create and maintain independently the URNs
  that fall within the scope of those authorities.

  Administrative units or agents wishing to assign URNs must be
  granted the appropriate privilege to do so from the administrator of
  the naming authority in the scope of which the URNs are to be
  created.  Similarly, units or agents wishing to administer a new
  delegated naming authority must negotiate directly with the
  administrator of the potential parent authority, who, if
  acquiescent, will create the delegated authority.

Process for identifier resolution:

  HUL provides a resolution service for the namespace.  The service
  accepts THTTP-formatted [2] resolution requests for the URN-to-URL
  and URN-to-URLs services (specified by either the "N2L" and "N2Ls"
  mnemonics of [2] or the "I2L" and "I2Ls" mnemonics of [3]).  Server
  responses are consistent with [3].

  Multiple URLs associated with a single URN are maintained within the
  resolver database in an ordered list.  A URN-to-URL request against
  a URN with multiple URLs returns the URL with the highest priority
  in the list.

  The mechanism used by client user agents to determine the location
  of the resolution service is outside of the scope of this
  registration document.

  In the absence of widely available native support for URNs within
  the current generation of web clients, the resolution service also
  accepts requests in a PURL-like syntax [5] for URNs that are
  encapsulated into URLs:

    http://<resolver>/urn-<n>:<authoritypath>:<resourcename>

  In this case, the URN-to-URL resolution service is assumed by the
  resolver.

Rules for Lexical Equivalence:  The entire URN is case-insensitive.

Conformance with URN syntax:  No special considerations.

Validation mechanism:

  The administrative system performs syntactic validation of all URNs
  at the point of their registration.

Scope:

  This namespace is used for the identification of network-accessible
  resources delivered to the Harvard community and the public through
  the mediation of HUL-supported systems or other delivery mechanisms
  controlled or directed by Harvard-affiliated entities whose
  standards and procedures for resource maintenance and access are
  consistent with those of HUL, or for resources made accessible to
  the Harvard community under contractual or similar arrangements.
  These resources are provided by various organizational units of
  Harvard University, including administrative and academic
  departments, libraries, and museums, as well as digital content
  purchased or licensed from external vendors.
