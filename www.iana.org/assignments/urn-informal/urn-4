The identifier structure is as follows:

<identifier> := "URN:" <assigned-number> ":" <namespace-specific-identifier>
<namespace-specific-identifier> := <identifier-piece> *("." <identifier-piece>)
<identifier-piece> := <let-num> ?(*<let-num-spec> <let-num>)
<let-num-spec> := <let-num> | "-" | "_"
<let-num> := "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" | "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
<assigned-number> := "URN-4"

where <assigned-number> is the number assigned to this urn scheme, and <namespace-specific-identifier> is an identifier assigned to a particular resource through the process of identifier assignment outlined below.  While the syntax of the <namespace-specific-identifier> suggests a hierarchal structure, an identifier being valid does not necessarily mean that the same identifier with one or more of the rightmost Identifier Pieces omitted is also valid.  In fact, in most cases it will not be.  For instance, if urn:####:TopLevelIdentifier.SubIdentifier.SubSubIdentifier is a valid URN, urn:####:TopLevelIdentfier.SubIdentifier and urn:####:TopLevelIdentfier are not necessarily valid URNs in this namespace.

Relevant ancillary information:
  None applicable.

Identifier Uniqueness Considerations:
  The maintainer of this urn namespace privately controls assignment of 
  identifiers and assignments are permanent.  So, provided that the maintainer 
  does not assign the same identifier to more than one resource (obviously), 
  uniqueness is guaranteed.

Identifier Persistence Considerations:
  All identifier assignments are permanent.

Process of Identifier Assignment:
  Assignment is completely closed.

Process for identifier resolution:
  For as long as this version of this urn specification is in effect, no URNs 
  in this URN namespace may be resolvable to a URL.  So, no such process is 
  needed at this time.  Future versions of this specification may specify a 
  process for identifier resolution, if needed.

Rules for Lexical Equivalence:
  The leading "urn:" token and the Namespace Identifier, which will be a number 
  assigned by IANA, are case-insensitive, as defined by RFC2141.  The rest of 
  the identifier, the Namespace Specific Identifier, is case-sensitive.

Conformance with URN Syntax:  
  No special considerations.

Validation Mechanism:  
  None specified.

Scope:  
  Global
