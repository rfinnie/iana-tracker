Charset aliases: MS_Kanji and csShiftJIS

Suitability for use in MIME text:

Note that this is an 8-bit charset. Care should be taken to choose an 
appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding.

Published specification(s): Appendix 1 of JIS X0208:1997.

ISO 10646 equivalency table:

The correspondence is defined in JIS X0208:1997, the Kanji mapping is
described in Appendix 6. Column 1 of Table 2 of Appendix 5 lists some
variation of punctuation, and the names given in Appendix 5 are
preferred to those in Appendix 4, when available.

In computer readable formats several variations exist. An obsolete
variation is available at:

Additional information:

This charset is an extension of csHalfWidthKatakana by adding graphic
characters in JIS X 0208. The CCS's are JIS X0201:1997 and JIS X0208:1997.

Several vendor specific charsets that derive from shift_jis often use
the shift_jis name instead of a more specific vendor charset name.
Windows-31J is one example, Mac Japanese and Java SJIS are others. A
common variation is to convert shift_jis 0x5c to U+005c Unicode, but
display it as the Yen sign.
