Windows Japanese. A variant of Shift_JIS to include NEC special characters 
(Row 13), NEC selection of IBM extensions (Rows 89 to 92), and IBM extensions 
(Rows 115 to 119). The CCS's are JIS X0201:1997, JIS X0208:1997, and these 
extensions. Windows-31J text is commonly declared with the shift_jis name of 
the parent charset, and the Windows-31J name may not be recognized.
