Charset name: utf-7-imap

Charset aliases: n/a

Suitability for use in MIME text: yes (but only technically so)

Published specification(s): RFC 3501 Section 5.1.3

ISO 10646 equivalency table: n/a (transformation format of Unicode, 1:1 mapping)

Additional information:

The purported alternative, RFC 6855, has not been implemented widely
according to:

<https://web.archive.org/web/20200513002011/https://imapwiki.org/Specs>

Therefore, interoperable clients need to implement utf-7-imap, and
this charset is still in wide use today, despite being currently
unnamed. It is expected that use of this charset remains restricted
to IMAP, but it's still useful to have a name for this charset, so
that charset processing implementations can refer to it in a
consistent way.

REVIEWER'S NOTE:

This charset is used to encode Unicode in IMAP mailbox names; see
section 5.1.3 of RFC 3501. It should never be used outside this context.
A name has been assigned so that charset processing implementations can
refer to it in a consistent way.
