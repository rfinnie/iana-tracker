Additional information:
 CESU-8 is an 8-bit Compatibility Encoding Scheme for UTF-16 (CESU) that
 is intended for internal use within systems processing Unicode in order
 to provide an ASCII-compatible 8-bit encoding that is similar to UTF-8 
 but preserves UTF-16 binary collation. Data encoded in CESU-8 should only
 be exchanged when it is labeled as such in a higher-level protocol or
 is agreed upon in an API definition.  CESU-8 is not intended nor
 recommended for open interchange.
