Charset name: CP51932

Charset aliases: csCP51932

Suitability for use in MIME text:

Yes, CP51932 is suitable for use with subtypes of the "text"
Content-Type. Since CP1932 is an 8bit charset care should be
taken to choose an appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding.

Published specification(s):

Octets with the high bit clear specify single US-ASCII characters, while
octets with the high bit set encode characters from the Windows Codepage
932 by combining the bits from the two octets except when the first octet
is 0x8E, in which case this represents Halfwidth Katakana.

Meaning and mapping to Unicode of each character is refer to
Windows Codepage 932.

Additional information:

CP51932 is a variant of EUC-JP (like Windows-31J and Shift_JIS).
this charset is different from EUC-JP in:
* CP51932 doesn't support JIS X 0212
* CP51932 supports characters extended by Windows Codepage 932
* Unicode mapping of some characters are different

Typical user of CP51932 is web browsers. When web browsers load
a page which are declared or auto-detected as "EUC-JP", they don't
interpret it as true EUC-JP registerd in IANA Character Sets but as
CP51932. When they post form data as "EUC-JP", the data is also
encoded as CP51932.

The name "CP51932" is in use following applications:
* Citrus iconv (NetBSD and DragonFly uses this)
* patched GNU libiconv in FreeBSD ports
* Mojikan http://www.mirai-ii.co.jp/moji/mojikan/
* nkf 2.0.5
* PHP 5.2.1
* Ruby 1.9.1
* Encode-EUCJPMS-0.06

Moreover applications which uses MLang.DLL or .NET Framework for
converting "EUC-JP" implicitly uses this charset.

Intended use of this name is to override the implementation of EUC-JP
or charset convertion.

Why the name is not "Windows-51932" is some of applications which accept
the name "CP51932" don't support the name "Windows-51932".

CP51932 is for use of importing legacy data.
UTF-8 is preferred to CP51932 for new system.
