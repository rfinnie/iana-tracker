Intended usage:

 "This set of coded graphic characters is intended for use in data and
  text processing applications and also for information interchange. The
  set contains graphic characters used for general purpose applications in
  typical office environments in at least the following languages:
  Albanian, Croatian, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Irish
  Gaelic (new orthography), Italian, Latin, Polish, Romanian, and
  Slovenian. This set of coded graphic characters may be regarded as a
  version of an 8-bit code according to ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at
  level 1." [ISO 8859-16:2001(E), p. 1]

  This charset is suitable for use in MIME text body parts.

  ISO 8859-16 was primarily designed for single-byte encoding the Romanian
  language. The UTF-8 charset is the preferred and in today's MIME software
  more widely implemented encoding suitable for Romanian.
