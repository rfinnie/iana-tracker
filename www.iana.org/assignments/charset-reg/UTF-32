The IETF registration imposes one additional constraint: if there is no
initial BOM then the byte-orientation must be big-endian. That is, in any
stream that does not begin with the (hex) byte sequence <00 00 FE FF> all of
the bytes are interpreted as big-endian.

Note: This is parallel to the IETF registration of UTF-16. As defined by the
Unicode Standard Version 3.1, without a BOM the byte orientation of UTF-32
and UTF-16 could be either little-endian or big-endian. The choice of byte
orientation would be determined by a higher-level protocol. The IETF
registration is such a protocol, and constrains the byte orientation to be
big-endian for determinant interpretation.
