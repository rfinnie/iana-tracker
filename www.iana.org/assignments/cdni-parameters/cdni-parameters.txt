   preposition A request for the dCDN to acquire metadata or content.                                           [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
               A request for the dCDN to invalidate metadata or content. After servicing this request the dCDN
   invalidate  will not use the specified data without first re-validating it using, for example, an            [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
               "If-None-Match" HTTP request. The dCDN need not erase the associated data.
               A request for the dCDN to erase metadata or content. After servicing the request, the specified
   purge       data MUST NOT be held on the dCDN (the dCDN should re-acquire the metadata or content from uCDN  [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
               if it needs it).

   emeta        The dCDN was unable to acquire metadata required to fulfil the request.                         [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
   econtent     The dCDN was unable to acquire content (CT/T preposition commands only).                        [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
   eperm        The uCDN does not have permission to issue the CI/T Command (for example, the data is owned by  [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
                another CDN).
   ereject      The dCDN is not willing to fulfil the CI/T Command (for example, a preposition request for      [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
                content at a time when the dCDN would not accept Request Routing requests from the uCDN).
   ecdn         An internal error in the dCDN or one of its downstream CDNs.                                    [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
   ecancelled   The uCDN cancelled the request.                                                                 [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
   eunsupported The Trigger Specification contained a "type" that is not supported by the dCDN. No action was   [RFC-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-15]
                taken by the dCDN other than to create a Trigger Status Resource in state "failed".
