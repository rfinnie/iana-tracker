                   The baseline Interface defines a view into all Properties of a Resource
   oic.if.baseline including the Meta Properties. This Interface is used to operate on the full [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   Representation of a Resource.
                   The 'links list' Interface provides a view into Links in a Collection
   oic.if.ll       (Resource). Since Links represent relationships to other Resources, the      [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   links list interfaces may be used to discover Resources with respect to a
                   context. The discovery is done by retrieving Links to these Resources.
                   The batch Interface is used to interact with a collection of Resources at
   oic.if.b        the same time. This also removes the need for the Client to first discover   [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   the Resources it is manipulating - the Server forwards the requests and
                   aggregates the responses.
                   The read-only Interface exposes the Properties of a Resource that may be
   oic.if.r        'read'. This Interface does not provide methods to update Properties or a    [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   Resource and so can only be used to 'read' Property Values.
                   The read-write Interface exposes only those Properties that may be both
   oic.if.rw       'read' and 'written' and provides methods to read and write the Properties   [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   of a Resource.
   oic.if.a        The actuator Interface is used to read or write the Properties of an         [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   actuator Resource.
   oic.if.s        The sensor Interface is used to read the Properties of a sensor Resource.    [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
