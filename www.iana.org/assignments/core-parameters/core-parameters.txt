                   Representation of a Resource.
                   The 'links list' Interface provides a view into Links
                   in a Collection (Resource). Since Links represent
   oic.if.ll       relationships to other Resources, the links list        [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   interfaces may be used to discover Resources with
                   respect to a context. The discovery is done by
                   retrieving Links to these Resources.
                   The batch Interface is used to interact with a
                   collection of Resources at the same time. This also
   oic.if.b        removes the need for the Client to first discover the   [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   Resources it is manipulating - the Server forwards the
                   requests and aggregates the responses.
                   The read-only Interface exposes the Properties of a
   oic.if.r        Resource that may be 'read'. This Interface does not    [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   provide methods to update Properties or a Resource and
                   so can only be used to 'read' Property Values.
                   The read-write Interface exposes only those Properties
   oic.if.rw       that may be both 'read' and 'written' and provides      [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   methods to read and write the Properties of a Resource.
   oic.if.a        The actuator Interface is used to read or write the     [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   Properties of an actuator Resource.
   oic.if.s        The sensor Interface is used to read the Properties of  [OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3]
                   a sensor Resource.
