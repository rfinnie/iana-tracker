oic.if.baseline,"The baseline Interface defines a view into all Properties of a 
        Resource including the Meta Properties. This Interface is used to operate 
        on the full Representation of a Resource.",[OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3],
oic.if.ll,"The 'links list' Interface provides a view into Links in a 
        Collection (Resource).
        Since Links represent relationships to other Resources, the links list 
        interfaces may be used to discover Resources with respect to a context. 
        The discovery is done by retrieving Links to these Resources.",[OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3],
oic.if.b,"The batch Interface is used to interact with a collection of 
        Resources at the same time. This also removes the need for the Client to 
        first discover the Resources it is manipulating - the Server forwards the 
        requests and aggregates the responses.",[OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3],
oic.if.r,"The read-only Interface exposes the Properties of a Resource 
        that may be 'read'. This Interface does not provide methods to update 
        Properties or a Resource and so can only be used to 'read' Property Values.",[OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3],
oic.if.rw,"The read-write Interface exposes only those Properties that 
        may be both 'read' and 'written' and provides methods to read and write 
        the Properties of a Resource.",[OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3],
oic.if.a,"The actuator Interface is used to read or write the Properties 
        of an actuator Resource.",[OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3],
oic.if.s,"The sensor Interface is used to read the Properties of a 
        sensor Resource.",[OIC_Core_Specification_v1.1.0 section 7.5.3],
