Resource Identifier (RI) Scheme name: bitcoin 
Status: provisional

Scheme semantics:
   Send money to a Bitcoin address

Encoding considerations:
   Unknown, use with care.

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:

Interoperability considerations:
   Unknown, use with care. 
   May be unsuitable for open use on the public internet.
Security considerations:
   Unknown, use with care.
   This scheme claims to be used to send money, which implies a commitment
   by the client user; as described is not clear that this scheme does not
   violate the web principle of safe interactions
   (http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#safe-interaction). In the absence of more
   details, it should be considered very dangerous to dereference a bitcoin
   URI.
