URI scheme name: submit

Status: provisional

URI scheme syntax:
submituri = "submit://" authority ["/" [ "?" query ]]
authority = <defined in RFC 3986>
query = <defined in RFC 3986>
If :<port> is omitted from authority, the port defaults to 587.
The query component is reserved for future extensions.

URI scheme semantics:
The submit: URI scheme is used to designate SMTP Submission
servers (e.g. listener endpoints, S/MIME agents performing Domain
signing), SMTP accounts.
There is no MIME type associated with this URI.

Encoding considerations:
SMTP user names are UTF-8 strings and MUST be percent-encoded as
required by the URI specification [RFC3986], Section 2.1.

Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:
The submit: URI is intended to be used by applications that might
need access to an SMTP Submission server (for example email
clients) or for SMTP Submission servers to describe their listener
endpoints.


Interoperability considerations:
None.

Security considerations: Clients resolving submit: URIs that wish
to achieve data confidentiality and/or integrity SHOULD use the
STARTTLS command (if supported by the server) before starting
authentication, or use a SASL mechanism, such as GSSAPI, that
provides a confidentiality security layer.
