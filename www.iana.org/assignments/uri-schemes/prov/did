Scheme name: did
Status: Provisional

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:

A "did" URI is used to express an identifier that is conformant to the
Decentralized Identifier[1] specification. The specification details how
identifiers conformant to the "did" URI Scheme can be implemented.

Applications that use this scheme name include ones that require an
identifier that is decentralized, persistent, cryptographically
verifiable, and resolvable. Applications typically consist of
cryptographic identity systems, decentralized networks of devices, and
websites that issue or verify W3C Verifiable Credentials.

This specification is currently under development in the W3C
Decentralized Identifier Working Group and is expected to become a W3C
standard at the end of 2021.
