o URI Scheme Name: view-source

o Status: Provisional

o URI Scheme Syntax: The 'view-source' URI takes the form of the
<view-source-uri> rule below, defined in ABNF [RFC5234]:

view-source-uri = "view-source:" absolute-URI

where the <absolute-URI> rule is defined in Appendix A of
RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

o URI Scheme Semantics: The 'view-source' URI is resolved the
source code of the resource, identified by <absolute-URI>.
Each application implementing the 'view-source' URI scheme
is permitted to choose how the source code is displayed.
The current practice is to represent the source code as a plain
text with the UTF-8 character encoding [RFC3629].

Current implementations resolve the 'view-source' URIs with URIs
that do not identify the resource but rather an endpoint for
establishing a connection, etc. (such as 'telnet' URIs [RFC4248])
in the <absolute-URI> via displaying a resource representing blank
page. URIs with "view-source:" prefixed more than once are usually
resolved in the same way.

o Encoding Considerations: There are no encoding considerations for
'view-source' URIs other than those discussed in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

o Applications and Protocols that Use this URI Scheme Name: The
'view-source' URIs is generally used by web-browsers.

See Wikipedia's entry on "View-source URI scheme" [WIKI-VIEW-SOURCE]
for the up-to-date list of browser support information

o Interoperability Considerations: The <absolute-URI> might sometimes
refer to source code that is under certain legal provisions, which
might not grant free access, or which might place other restrictions
on the use of the source code. The users of such information should
be careful regarding these matters.

o Security Considerations: General security consideration for URIs
are discussed in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. See also Interoperability
Considerations field of this template for some issues concerning
security
