References: The URI format is defined in Wi-Fi Alliance Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) specification to provide an extensible, efficient method of provisioning configuration and credentials for Wi-Fi network access. The URI definition is backwards compatible with the de-facto standard format used by popular commercial devices, and provides explicit support for new security features introduced by WPA3. It provides a common format for provisioning credentials in a Quick Response (QR) code or other secure channel. Please refer to section 7 of the specification available at: https://www.wi-fi.org/file/wpa3-specification.
