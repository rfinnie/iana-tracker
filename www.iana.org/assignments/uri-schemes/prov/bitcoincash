This scheme claims to be used to send money, which implies a 
commitment by the client user; as described is not clear that this 
scheme does not violate the web principle of safe interactions
(http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#safe-interaction). In the absence of 
more details, it should be considered very dangerous to dereference a
bitcoin URI.
