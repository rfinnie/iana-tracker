NOTE: If this URI scheme is made available on the web, implementers must ensure that the act of retrieving a barion: URI cannot, of itself, cause a payment to be sent. Users are warned to make sure that the installed Barion payment application asks for sender user credentials and verification of the recipient and the sum before performing the actual transaction.
