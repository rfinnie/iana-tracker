URI scheme name:
iax2.

Status:
Provisional.

URI scheme syntax:
The "iax2:" scheme follows the guidelines in [RFC3986].

The general form is as follows:

iax2:[username@]host[:port][/number[?context]]

where these tokens have the following meanings:

iax2: The literal 'iax2:'.

username: A string used for identification purposes.

host: The domain of the resource. The host part contains
either a fully-qualified domain name or numeric IPv4 or IPv6
address. An IPv6 address must be enclosed within brackets
(i.e., '[2001:db8::1]') as defined in [RFC3986]. Using the
fully-qualified domain name form is RECOMMENDED whenever
possible.

port: The numeric UDP port number.

number: The name or number identifying the resource on that
host.

context: The name of the host partition in which the service is
identified or processed.


Examples

iax2:atlanta.com/alice
iax2:atlanta.com:4569/alice
iax2:atlanta.com:4570/alice?friends
iax2:192.0.2.4:4569/alice?friends
iax2:[2001:db8::1]:4569/alice?friends
iax2:whitehouse.gov/12022561414
iax2:johnQ&whitehouse.gov/12022561414

ABNF Certain values are included by reference from [RFC3986]

iax2-uri = "iax2:" [userinfo "@" ]host[":" port][ "/" number[
"?" context]]

userinfo = // as specified in RFC 3986

host = // as specified in RFC 3986

port = // as specified in RFC 3986

number = *(unreserved | sub-delims | pct-encoded )

context = *(unreserved | sub-delims | pct-encoded )

unreserved = // as specified in RFC 3986

sub-delims = // as specified in RFC 3986

pct-encoded = // as specified in RFC 3986

URI Scheme Semantics:

An IAX2 URI identifies a communications resource capable of
communicating using the IAX2 Version 2 protocol defined in this
document. Within this document, we refer to IAX2 Version 2
protocol URI as IAX2. An IAX2 URI contains enough information to
initiate an IAX2-based call with that resource.

IAX2 URIs are associated with server resources to which calls may
be routed. For instance, an IAX2 URI may represent an appearance
on a phone, a voice-mail box on a messaging service, an
interactive program, a PSTN address or gateway, or any group of
the above.

The iax2 uri scheme translates into a location that may be used by
the iax2 protocol to establish a new call using the uri scheme
components described in the previous section. This new call
function is the only defined operation.

Encoding considerations:

IAX2 URI scheme encoding conforms to the encoding rules
established for URIs in [RFC3986].

Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:

The scheme is used by ENUM DDDS services to specify resources that
support the IAX2 protocol. The IAX2 protocol provides
application-layer control and media protocol for creating,
modifying, and terminating multimedia sessions over Internet
Protocol (IP) networks.

Interoperability considerations:

None.

Security considerations:

The IAX2 URI Scheme does not introduce any new security concerns
except that it provides a uniform syntax for describing IAX2
resources and that, when published, these addresses are subject to
various denial os service attacks.
