Description:
     The wpid scheme was introduced in the nominated best paper 
     at the iPRES 2016 conference ("Persistent Web References 
     – Best Practices and New Suggestions", and can be found in the 
     iPRES 2016 proceedings [IPRES]. There have been a lot of useful 
     comments which are taken into account in a RFC to be submitted 
     before end of 2016. 
     
     The name "wpid" will be changed to "pwid" as a result of the  
     comments. The reasons are:
     * There was a concern that wpid was interpreted as a PID related
       to a PID-system as e.g. the DOI. All though PID does not have
       a precise definition that makes it wrong to call it a wpid,
       the danger is that it is confused with PID systems which is not
       the intension
     * As the title of the iPres 2016 conference paper suggests, the
       name ´"Persistent Web Identifier" is more straightforward than
       "Web Persistent Identifier"
