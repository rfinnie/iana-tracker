URI scheme name.
jabber

Status.
permanent

URI scheme syntax.
The only allowable strings are:

- jabber:client
- jabber:component:accept
- jabber:component:connect
- jabber:component:exec
- jabber:iq:agent
- jabber:iq:agents
- jabber:iq:auth
- jabber:iq:autoupdate
- jabber:iq:browse
- jabber:iq:conference
- jabber:iq:gateway
- jabber:iq:groupchat
- jabber:iq:last
- jabber:iq:oob
- jabber:iq:privacy
- jabber:iq:private
- jabber:iq:register
- jabber:iq:roster
- jabber:iq:rpc
- jabber:iq:search
- jabber:iq:time
- jabber:iq:version
- jabber:server
- jabber:x:autoupdate
- jabber:x:conference
- jabber:x:data
- jabber:x:delay
- jabber:x:encrypted
- jabber:x:envelope
- jabber:x:event
- jabber:x:expire
- jabber:x:oob
- jabber:x:roster
- jabber:x:signed

These strings are used literally as shown, with the
specified case (e.g., "jabber" not "JABBER") and no
possibility of percent-encoding (e.g., the string
"jabber:%63lient" is not allowed and is not equivalent
to or transformed into the string "jabber:client").

URI scheme semantics.
Strings of the form 'jabber:*' and 'jabber:*:*' were
minted for use as XML namespace names during development
of the technology that became the Extensible Messaging
and Presence Protocol (XMPP). Note well that defining
new URI schemes for XML namespaces is now discouraged,
and that the 'jabber' scheme was (inadvertently) created
before standard best practices emerged for XML namespaces.
The 'jabber' scheme was never used for any purpose other
than XML namespace names, and is not designed or intended
for any other use. In particular, the 'jabber' scheme
must not be used to identify or enable interaction with
XMPP addresses; the 'xmpp' scheme defined in RFC 5122 is
to be used in such cases. The only namespace names
minted with this scheme are listed in the syntax definition
section of this registration. No other names were minted,
and new names shall not be minted (i.e., the scheme is closed
to generation of new URIs).

Encoding considerations.
None. Because the limited number of URIs (XML namespace
names) minted with this scheme contain characters only
from the ASCII range, encoding of internationalized code
points is out of scope. In addition, these namespace names
do not contain any text fields that would be subject to
specialized encoding.

Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name.
Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). Note
well that these URIs are used only as XML namespace names
within XMPP streams and are not intended for use in any
other context.

Interoperability considerations.
None.

Security considerations.
See Section 13 of RFC 6120.
