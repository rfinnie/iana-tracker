1. URI scheme name

videotex

2. Status

historical

3. URI scheme syntax

"videotex://" login [ "/" videotexservice *[ parameter ] ]
For details see the historical reference, a <login> was in
essence what STD 66 specifies as <authority>.

4. URI scheme semantics

For details see the historical reference, the default port
assigned by IANA is 516. For a rough idea "videotex" was
an URI scheme in the direction of "tn3270" and "telnet".
The "vemmi" URL scheme specified in RFC 2122 for port 575
was apparently designed to obsolete "videotex" URLs.

5. Encoding considerations

The historical reference does not go into details. Picking
an $EMULATION included values CEPT1 (BTX), CEPT2 (Teletel
latin mode), CEPT2GREEK (Teletel greek mode), CEPT2ARABIC,
CEPT3 (Prestel), CEPT4, NAPLPS, CAPTAIN, VT52, VT100, VT220,
and a way for servers to determine the capabilities of the
client.

6. Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name

Various Videotex services existed, among them Prestel, Minitel,
BTX. In the time of the transition to the WWW client software
needed to support legacy Videotex services of the corresponding
providers.

7. Interoperability considerations

HTTP and the WWW were soon more popular than all predecessors
not limited to Videotex.

8. Security considerations

See STD 66 for a discussion of the "user:password@" construct
in an <authority>.

9. Contact

<URL:mailto:uri&w3.org> (URI mailing list)

10. Author/Change controller

The historical reference mentions an ETSI TE1 WG, the authors
later published RFC 2122 on standards track, change control by
the IETF is good enough for this historical scheme.
