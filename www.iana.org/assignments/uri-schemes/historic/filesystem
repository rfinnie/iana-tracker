  This scheme was part of the "File API: Directories and System"
  W3C Working Draft.  It was intended to be implemented by web user
  agents such as web browsers.  The specification did not gain traction
  and was abandoned.  At the time of writing this registration, the
  specification is only known to be implemented in the Google Chrome
  family of web browsers, under a "webkit" vendor prefix.
