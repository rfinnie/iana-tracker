URI scheme name:
pack

Status:
historical

URI scheme syntax:
There was no pack: syntax compatible with STD 66, cf.
<http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/uri-review/current/msg00678.html>,
<http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/uri-review/current/msg00548.html>.

URI scheme semantics:
n/a due to a lack of STD 66 syntax.

Encoding considerations:
The pack: encoding assumed US-ASCII after un-escaping percent-encoded
characters in an encapsulated <authority> (4.c in the expired drafts)
and case-insensitive US-ASCII in the <path> (5.c in the expired drafts).

Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:
The pack: scheme could not be used as an URI scheme in applications
or protocols. Other uses of pack: are noted in the expired drafts.

Interoperability considerations:
All URI schemes have to follow the generic STD 66 syntax, as that was
not the case for pack: any "interoperability" would be by the chance
of similarly broken implementations.

Security considerations:
The generic and overall URI syntax is specified in STD 66, anything
else (not limited to pack:) is no URI and could cause havoc.

with consent of IESG-designated expert.
