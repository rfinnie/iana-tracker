Description:
MultiMarkdown (MMD) is a superset of "Original". It adds multiple
syntax features (tables, footnotes, and citations, to name a few)
and is intended to output to various formats. Additionally, it builds
in "smart" typography for various languages (proper left- and right-
sided quotes, for example).

Additional Parameters:

          by whitespace (WSP)

             "full" / "snippet"
             "process-html"
             "random-footnote-identifiers"
             "accept"

             "nonotes"
             "nolabels"
