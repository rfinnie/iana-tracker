   syntax features (tables, footnotes, and citations, to name a few),

   sided quotes, for example).","options: String with zero or more of the following WSP-delimited

pandoc,Pandoc,"Markdown is designed to be easy to write and to read: the content
   should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it
   has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. Yet whereas
   ""Original"" has HTML generation in mind, pandoc is designed for
   multiple output formats. Thus, while pandoc allows the embedding of
   raw HTML, it discourages it, and provides other, non-HTMLish ways of
   representing important document elements like definition lists,
   tables, mathematics, and footnotes.","extensions: String with an optional starting syntax token, followed
