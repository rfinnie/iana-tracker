Identifier: CommonMark

Name: CommonMark

Description:
CommonMark is a standard, unambiguous syntax specification for
Markdown, along with a suite of comprehensive tests to validate
Markdown implementations against this specification. The maintainers
believe that CommonMark is necessary, even essential, for the future
of Markdown.

Compared to "Original", CommonMark is much longer and in a few
instances contradicts "Original" based on seasoned experience.
Although CommonMark specifically does not mandate any particular
encoding for the input content, CommonMark draws in more of Unicode,
UTF-8, and HTML (including HTML5) than "Original".

This registration always refers to the latest version or an
unspecified version (receiver's choice). Version 0.13 of the
CommonMark specification was released 2014-12-10.
