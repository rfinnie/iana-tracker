Description:
Markdown Extra is an extension to PHP Markdown implementing some
features currently not available with the plain Markdown syntax.
Markdown Extra is available as a separate parser class in PHP
Markdown Lib. Other implementations include Maruku (Ruby) and Python
Markdown. Markdown Extra is supported in several content management
systems, including Drupal, TYPO3, and MediaWiki.
