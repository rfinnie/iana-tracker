0,mechoff,"An off state where no Energy Object features 
        are available. The Energy Object is unavailable. No energy is being 
        consumed, and the power connector can be removed.",[RFC7326]
1,softoff,"Similar to mechoff(0), but some components remain powered or 
        receive trace power so that the Energy Object can be awakened from its 
        off state. In softoff(1), no context is saved, and the device typically 
        requires a complete boot when awakened.",[RFC7326]
2,hibernate,"No Energy Object features are available. The Energy Object 
        may be awakened without requiring a complete boot, but the time for 
        availability is longer than sleep(3). An example for state hibernate(2) 
        is a save-to-disk state where DRAM context is not maintained. Typically, 
        energy consumption is zero or close to zero.",[RFC7326]
3,sleep,"No Energy Object features are available, except for 
        out-of-band management, such as wake-up mechanisms. The time for 
        availability is longer than standby(4). An example for state sleep(3) 
        is a save-to-RAM state, where DRAM context is maintained. Typically, 
        energy consumption is close to zero.",[RFC7326]
4,standby,"No Energy Object features are available, except for 
        out-of-band management, such as wake-up mechanisms. This mode is 
        analogous to cold-standby. The time for availability is longer than 
        ready(5). For example, processor context may not be maintained. 
        Typically, energy consumption is close to zero.",[RFC7326]
5,ready,"No Energy Object features are available, except for 
        out-of-band management, such as wake-up mechanisms. This mode is 
        analogous to hot-standby. The Energy Object can be quickly transitioned 
        into an operational state. For example, processors are not executing, 
        but processor context is maintained.",[RFC7326]
6,lowMinus,"Indicates that some Energy Object features may not be 
        available and the Energy Object has taken measures or selected options 
        to use less energy than low(7).",[RFC7326]
7,low,"Indicates that some Energy Object features may not be 
        available and the Energy Object has taken measures or selected options 
        to use less energy than mediumMinus(8).",[RFC7326]
8,mediumMinus,"Indicates that all Energy Object features are available but 
        the Energy Object has taken measures or selected options to use less 
        energy than medium(9).",[RFC7326]
9,medium,"Indicates that all Energy Object features are available but 
        the Energy Object has taken measures or selected options to use less 
        energy than highMinus(10).",[RFC7326]
10,highMinus,"Indicates that all Energy Object features are available and 
        the Energy Object has taken measures or selected options to use less 
        energy than high(11).",[RFC7326]
11,high,"Indicates that all Energy Object features are available and 
        the Energy Object may use the maximum energy as indicated by the 
        Nameplate Power.",[RFC7326]
