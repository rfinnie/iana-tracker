English name of language   : Bosnian in Cyrillic script
Native name of language (transcribed into ASCII): bosanski

Reference to published description of the language (book or article):

Bosnian is customarily written both in Cyrillic script and also in Latin script.

It is often required, when matching languages, to select a subset of documents 
written in a particular script. When looking up language resources, this is even 
more important, so that text in different scripts is not mixed.

Thus, it is important to be able to distinguish between scripts used in 
writing bs: bs-Cyrl vs. bs-Latn.
