English name of language   : Tajik in Arabic script
Native name of language (transcribed into ASCII): tojiki

Reference to published description of the language (book or article):

Tajik is often written today in Cyrillic script, though Arabic script 
was predominant prior to 1928 and is still used today, and Latin script 
has also been in use since 1928.

It is often required, when matching languages, to select a subset of 
documents written in a particular script. When looking up language resources, 
this is even more important, so that text in different scripts is not mixed.

Thus, it is important to be able to distinguish between scripts used in 
writing tg: tg-Arab vs. tg-Cyrl, etc.
