English name of language   : Inuktitut in Canadian Aboriginal
Syllabic script Native name of language (transcribed into ASCII): inuktitut

Reference to published description of the language (book or article):

Inuktitut is customarily written both in Latin script and in the Canadian 
Aboriginal Syllabic script.

It is often required, when matching languages, to select a subset of documents 
written in a particular script. When looking up language resources, this is 
even more important, so that text in different scripts is not mixed.

Thus, it is important to be able to distinguish between scripts used in 
writing iu: iu-Cans vs. iu-Latn.
