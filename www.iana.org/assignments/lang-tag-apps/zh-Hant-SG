
LANGUAGE TAG REGISTRATION FORM

(last updated 26 April 2005)

Name of requester          : Mark Davis
E-mail address of requester: mark.davis&us.ibm.com
Tag to be registered       : zh-Hant-SG
English name of language   : Singapore Chinese in traditional script
Native name of language (transcribed into ASCII): zhong wen (fan ti zi, xin jiapo)

Reference to published description of the language (book or article):

RFC 3066 currently provides for the language tag zh-SG, to mark any distinctions 
in the Chinese used in Singapore.

However, Chinese is customarily written in multiple scripts, Traditional (Hant) 
and Simplified (Hans). It is often required, when matching languages, to select a 
subset of documents written in a particular script. When looking up language resources, 
this is even more important, so that text in different scripts is not mixed. For 
that reason, it is important to be able to distinguish the two scripts used in 
writing zh-SG: zh-Hant-SG vs zh-Hans-SG.
