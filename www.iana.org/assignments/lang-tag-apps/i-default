RFC 2277

Any other relevant information:

For information, here is the section of RFC 2277 that definesDefault Language. It is probably a Good Thing to keep this with theregistration in the IANA registry.4.5.  Default Language   When human-readable text must be presented in a context where the   sender has no knowledge of the recipient's language preferences (such   as login failures or E-mailed warnings, or prior to language   negotiation), text SHOULD be presented in Default Language.   Default Language is assigned the tag "i-default" according to the   procedures of RFC 1766. It is not a specific language, but rather   identifies the condition where the language preferences of the user   cannot be established.   Messages in Default Language MUST be understandable by an English-   speaking person, since English is the language which, worldwide, the   greatest number of people will be able to get adequate help in   interpreting when working with computers.   Note that negotiating English is NOT the same as Default Language;   Default Language is an emergency measure in otherwise unmanageable   situations.   In many cases, using only English text is reasonable; in some cases,   the English text may be augumented by text in other languages.========
