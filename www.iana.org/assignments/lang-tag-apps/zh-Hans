Reference to published description of the language (book or article):

Chinese is customarily written in two very different script variants, 
called simplified and traditional. It is often required, when 
matching languages, to select a subset of documents written in a 
particular script variant. When looking up language resources, this 
is even more important, so that text in different script variants is 
not mixed.
