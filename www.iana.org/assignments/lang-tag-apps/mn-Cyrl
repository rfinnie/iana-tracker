Native name of language (transcribed into ASCII): mongol

Reference to published description of the language (book or article):

Mongolian has been written since the 12th century CE in the Mongolian script, but has 
at times also been written in Arabic, Chinese and Phags-pa scripts, and most recently 
also Cyrillic script. Since 1941, Cyrillic script has been the primary script used in 
the country of Mongolia, while Mongolian script is the primary script used in China.

It is often required, when matching languages, to select a subset of documents written 
in a particular script. When looking up language resources, this is even more important, 
so that text in different scripts is not mixed.

Thus, it is important to be able to distinguish between scripts used in writing 
mn: mn-Cyrl vs. mn-Mong, etc.
