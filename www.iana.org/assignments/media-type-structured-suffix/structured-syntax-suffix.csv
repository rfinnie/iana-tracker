      See above, and also Section 3, for guidelines on the use of the 'charset' parameter.","Registrations which use this
      '+xml' convention MUST also make reference to [RFC7303],
      specifically Section 5, in specifying fragment identifier syntax
      and semantics, and they MAY restrict the syntax to a specified
      subset of schemes, except that they MUST NOT disallow barenames or
      'element' scheme pointers.  They MAY further require support for
      other registered schemes.  They also MAY add additional syntax
      (which MUST NOT overlap with [XPointerFramework] syntax) together
      with associated semantics, and MAY add additional semantics for
      barename XPointers which, as provided for in Section 5, will only

      In practice these constraints imply that for a fragment
      identifier addressed to an instance of a specific ""xxx/yyy+xml""
      type, there are three cases:
      
      
      For fragment identifiers matching the syntax defined in
      [XPointerFramework], where the fragment identifier resolves
      per the rules specified there, then process as specified
      there;
      
      
      For fragment identifiers matching the syntax defined in

      _not_ resolve per the rules specified there, then process as
      specified in ""xxx/yyy+xml"";
      
      
      For fragment identifiers _not_ matching the syntax defined

      ""xywh=160,120,320,240"", as defined in [MediaFrags], which
