Purpose:

Namespace needed for identifiers defined by ITU, including those used
in YANG modules RFC 6020 [2] RFC 7950 [3].  In YANG, identifiers
identify different kinds of YANG constructs.  An identifier is a
valid namespace which provides the scope for YANG modules and the
leafs, lists, etc.

Syntax:

urn:{ITU-NamespaceId}:{ITU-Sector}:{SectorResource}:{SectorResourceSpecificString}

* ITU-NamespaceId: "itu" (International Telecommunications Union)
* ITU-Sector: Currently defined values for sector below (potentially 
  others in the future):
     o 'r': Radiocommunication Sector
     o 't': Telecommunication Standardization Sector
     o 'd': Telecommunication Development Sector.
* SectorResource: type of resource (specific to each sector)
* SectorResourceSpecificString: information about the resource 
  (specific to each sector).

ITU will manage the assignment of "ITU-Sector", "SectorResource", and
"SectorResourceSpecificString".  When matching two ITU URNs for
equivalence the rules for lexical equivalence covered in Section 3 of
RFC 8141 [1] apply.  The ITU process is found in the ITU URN
Management [4] document.

The "ITU-Sector" and "SectorResource" are US-ASCII strings that
conform to the URN syntax requirements RFC 8141 [1].  "ITU-Sector"
identifies the ITU organizational group (sector).  "SectorResource"
defines a specific type of resource.  Each resource type has a
specific labeling scheme that is covered by
"SectorResourceSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming
requirements.

ITU will manage the assignment of "ITU-Sector", "SectorResource", and
the specific registration values assigned for each resource.

The ITU process is found in the ITU URN Management [4] document.

For clarity, an example of how the ITU plans to manage the resources
under the IANA provisioned NamespaceId follows:

urn:{ITU-NamespaceId}:{ITU-Sector}:{SectorResource}:{SectorResourceSpecificString}

* ITU-NamespaceId: "itu" (International Telecommunications Union)
* ITU-Sector: 't' (ITU-T)
* SectorResource: "rec" (ITU-T recommendation)
* SectorResourceSpecificString:
  {ITU-T-RecommendationNumber}:{ITU-T-RecommendationSpecficString}
     o ITU-T-RecommendationNumber: "g.8052.1" (ITU-T Recommendation 
       G.8052.1)
     o ITU-T-RecommendationSpecificString:
         {ITU-T-RecommendationType}:{ITU-T-RecommendationTypeIdentifier}
             + ITU-T-RecommendationType: "yang" (YANG)
             + ITU-T-RecommendationTypeIdenfifier: connectivity 
               (Example YANG module name)

So a complete example that provides the URI for a connectivity yang
model for the G.8052.1 Recommendation in the ITU-T would be:

urn:itu:t:rec:g.8052.1:yang:connectivity

Assignment: 

Each ITU sector manages this URN identification model and the
assignment of identifiers within it to resources.  Each ITU's sector
will ensure the uniqueness of the strings themselves or will permit
secondary responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.

Security and Privacy:

See the material in the Security Considerations (Section 5) section.

Interoperability:

The purpose of the ITU namespace and its use for YANG is meant to aid
interoperability by avoiding duplicate or conflicting namespaces.

Resolution:

No resolution mechanism is intended or anticipated.

Documentation:

The ITU maintains a Uniform Resource Names (URN) document that
provides the mechanism to ensure the resource identifiers are unique.
The ITU URN Management [4] document contains the formatting
guidelines for the URN hierarchy that is rooted at the base URN that
was assigned by IANA.

Additional Information:

None.
