Purpose:

The '3gpp2' namespace is used to identify mobile equipment which uses
technologies defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project 2
((3GPP2); initially such equipment is identified by a URN that embeds
a Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) that is 15 hexadecimal digits long
and unique to each individual mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or
mobile phone).

Syntax:

The identifier is expressed in American Standard Code for Information
Interchange (ASCII) characters and has a hierarchical expression
using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) defined in [RFC5234], as
follows:

pp2-urn              = "urn:" pp2-NID ":" pp2-NSS
pp2-NID              = "3gpp2"
pp2-NSS              = meid-specifier / future-pp2-specifier
meid-specifier       = "meid:" meidval
future-pp2-specifier = future-specifier *[ ":" 1*( pchar / "/" ]
future-specifier     = 1*pp2-char
pp2-char             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / pct-encoded

where 'pchar' and 'pct-encoded' are defined in [RFC3986].  An NSS for
the MEID is defined under the '3gpp2' NID.

The representation of the MEID is a specific number of hexadecimal
digits, as described in [S.R0048-A].

The formal definition of a URN with 'meid' NSS contains one meidval
with the formal definition according to the following ABNF [RFC5234]:

meidval           = Manufacturer-Code "-" Serial-Number
Manufacturer-Code = 8HEX
Serial-Number     = 6HEX
HEX               = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

Assignment:

The Manufacturer Code and Serial Number portions of the MEID are
permanently stored in the mobile equipment so they remain persistent
as long as the mobile equipment exists.  The process for Manufacturer
Code and Serial Number assignment is documented in [SC.R4002-0] and
the Manufacturer Code and Serial Number values once assigned are not
re-assigned to other mobile equipments.

Identifiers in the '3gpp2' namespace are defined and assigned by the
3GPP2 or an agency appointed by 3GPP2 after ensuring that the URNs to
be assigned are unique.  Procedures are in place to ensure that each
MEID is uniquely assigned by the mobile equipment manufacturer so
that it is guaranteed to uniquely identify that particular mobile
equipment.

Security and Privacy:

See Section 6 of RFC 8464.

Interoperability:

Although both the 3GPP2 Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) and the 3GPP
International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI) are used to
identity mobile equipment, they are separate identifiers and are not
to be confused.

Internet implementations will not generally possess MEID identifiers.
The identifiers generated by such implementations will typically be
URNs within namespaces other than '3gpp2', and may, depending on
context, even be non-URN URIs.  Implementations are advised to be
ready to process URIs other than '3gpp2' namespaced URNs, so as to
aid in interoperability.

Resolution: 

No resolution is envisioned.

Documentation: 

Documentation can be found in the following specifications:

o  A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Device Identity and the
   Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)"
   [RFC8464].

o  3G Mobile Equipment Identifier [S.R0048-A]
   <http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/Specs/S.R0048-A_v4.0_050630.pdf>.

o  GHA (Global Hexadecimal Administrator) Assignment Guidelines and
   Procedures for Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID) and Short Form
   Expanded UIM Identifier (SF_EUIMID) [SC.R4002-0]

Additional Information:

Because the syntax of a 3GPP2 Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)
differs from that of a 3GPP International Mobile station Equipment
Identity (IMEI), reuse of the URN specified in RFC 7254 is not
possible.
